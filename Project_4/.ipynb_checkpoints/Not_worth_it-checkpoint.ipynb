       "[{'body': 'I have a fairly athletic body and do all the right things--eat a healthy, low-calorie diet, exercise five days a week, etc. But ever since high school, I\\'ve had saddle bags, and they never responded to diet or exercise. It seemed like I would lose weight everywhere BUT my thighs, which then made them look even bigger in comparison! I didn\\'t want to get liposuction--it seemed a little extreme, and I wasn\\'t willing to have that kind of downtime. When I found out about Coolsculpting, I decided to give it a try.\\n             \\n             Everyone at Dr. Rapaport\\'s office is professional, knowledgeable, courteous, and in no way pushy. I was expecting subtle results, hoping for moderate ones, but my actual results? DRAMATIC! I won\\'t lie; I did have some pain the first ten or so days after my treatment, but the results made it very much worth it. The treatment itself is painless. Uncomfortable and cold, yes, but you can watch Netflix and it\\'s over before you know it.\\n             \\n             Around six weeks after my first session, I ever-so-casually ordered my older sister to inspect my pantless legs. \"How do my saddle bags look?\" I asked.\\n             \\n             Bored, she scanned me up and down. \"You don\\'t have any,\" she said. You should know that not only is my sister not the type who would ever lie to protect someone\\'s feelings, but she and I have the same body type and used to refer to our saddlebags as our \"side butts\" (she was also behind me in a yoga class once while we were doing pigeon pose, and she started giggling and told me it looked like I had four butts. Gotta love family.) I had thought my thighs were looking slimmer, but of course, we are always our own harshest critics, and I also wasn\\'t sure if I was just seeing what I wanted to see. Over the course of the next few days though, I had numerous unsolicited comments from friends, family, and even acquaintances about how I looked thinner. When I went in for my followup appointment and saw my \"before\" pictures, it REALLY hit me how amazing my results were. I thought, hey, if it worked so well the first time, why not aim for perfection?\\n             \\n             The second time around, I had no pain whatsoever, and now I can agree with my sister that I don\\'t have saddlebags. I am so shocked and happy that a non-surgical procedure gave me this kind of result. One of my friends saw how well it worked for me and booked a Coolsculpting appointment with Dr. Rapaport right away. I really recommend the treatment for anyone who has stubborn fat that doesn\\'t respond to exercise or diet. Now that I\\'m so happy with my outer thighs and know Coolsculpting works so well, I\\'m going to treat my inner thighs.',\n",

       " {'body': \"For a very long time now I have been thinking about doing something about my bulging tummy, inner thighs and underarms. I have a fairly active lifestyle. I go to the gym 5 times a week, eat heathy ( most of the time!) and very conscious of weight management but these areas do not seem to reflect that. No matter how hard I try so I decided to get some help. I have done several online research and spoken to folks who have had treatment for similar problem areas. I finally decided this year, to take a step and go for a consultation . I had 2, first one strongly suggested laser lipo, second was of the opinion that Coolsculpting will achieve my desired results with much less invasion and side effects to reduce downtime. Coolsculpting appealed to me for those reasons but I must confess the 25% fat reduction wasn't appealing! But after seeing some before and after photos, I decided to go for it. My provider was most professional and assuring, candidly telling me the limitations and expectations of the procedure. The treatment itself was ok. I was very comfortable and watched a movie and chatted online with my concerned family throughout. No pain, just pressure from suction which disappears very soon after. The massage was the worst part and that itself was ok. Please be aware of the possible side effects and plan in advance for pain management. Do your research and get some education. Pain became worse from day 5. On day 6, I took a 6 hour flight to my home country and boy! did the pain got worse?!(apparently traveling for longer than 1.5 hrs soon after procedure should be avoided... I read that online after the fact!). I had to go to a clinic to get some pain relief shot and tablets. That was yesterday... Today I feel good with minor swelling . I am looking forward to a great result and will do my thighs and under arms if this works well. I wait patiently.......photos to be posted from week 2\",\n",

       " {'body': 'I was very optimistic about having the procedure. I was excited that there was no down time and not exposing myself to the danger of going under. I bought 10 sessions and was looking forward to the new improved me. I had my stomach done first in two sessions with the large applicator. It was not painful at all. I felt fine through out the whole procedure with out any side effects. Yes, it was very cold and numbing on my stomach but not unbearable at all. The massage after was not painful. I left with a waist trainer type body suit. I did not have any swelling or bruising following the procedure. I was told it will take 12 weeks to see the results but it was common to see results as soon as 4-8 weeks. The next week I did both of my arms. I had the same experience as I did with my stomach. I was so excited I was finally going to have the kind of arms that would look great in a strapless dress. So I waited and waited and waited. Nothing! They only took pictures at the office, no measurements. I took measurements before and after for my own records. I did not get any results in my stomach area or my arms. I felt like I was scammed! Money spent and wasted for nothing! I had two more sessions for my arms left but I decided to get a refund for those two sessions since I did not get any results. I did not want to waste any more of my hard earned money. Remember, I have 4 kids. I finally spent money on myself for something that was not necessary but something that would make me look better and feel better. I have always put my children first and put off doing something like this because the money can go towards something that is more valuable like college! The company I used was going to uncharge me for the 8 procedures since I got a discount for 10 and refund me the difference left over which would of been only like $310. I was not going for that! It is unfair to charge me more for a procedure that I had 0 results from. The company finally agreed to refund me the full cost of the two sessions that I was cancelling. I did not get a refund or any offer to re-treat me for the 8 sessions I paid for with 0 results. I did not get a follow up call about my dissatisfaction. I would not recommend this procedure. Save your money!',\n",

The first week feels like 8 centimetres dialated, and it goes down to 6 by the last week but believe me it is RIDICULOUS!\\n             \\n\\n             I was prescribed Neurotin- did nothing. Like dropping a penny in an ocean- ZERO relief. I had to freeze my stomach with ice packs round the clock. At night is the worst time. An ice pack won\\'t last 8 hours so I wake up in a panic of pain to replace my ice packs. I sleep with a tight under garment which I tuck the ice packs into. My skin is literally hot to the touch if I go more than 15 mins without an ice pack on it. I\\'m burning up literally. THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART! Please do not think that this will be bare-able! If you need more than one treatment- just consider an alternative like liposuction!\\n             \\n\\n             I spoke with the clinic doctor and he has sent a script for Lyrica to my pharmacy for me to try. I am nervous Because reviews indicate that is causes water retention and weight gain DESPITE exercise and decreased caloric intake- CONTRARY TO WHAT I AM TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. Dr. Says I shouldn\\'t be concerned if I only take it for 2 weeks.\\n             \\n\\n\\n             In any event- I \"think\" I\\'m having results. My skin in most definitely looser on my lower abdomen. I was 41 inches in diameter on my lower abdomen when I started and I am now 38 and a half. The thing is I was routinely bloated, however 2 and a half inches down is really not something I could have faked by bloating. Also good to note I did lose 11lbs since starting this journey however.\\n             \\n\\n             In the first picture you can literally see how the top half of my stomach is bulging past the lower half.',\n",

I heard that CoolSculpting would help target the troublesome areas and help get rid of the fat so I decided to try it. So far, I had it done on my lower abs. During the consultation, the nurse (yes, shes a real nurse) told me to pop two extra strength tylenol 30 mins - 1 hr before the treatment to minimize pain so I proceeded to do that before my treatment.\\n             \\n\\n             For me, I didn't feel much discomfort. The technician applied a gel sheet to protect the skin and placed the suction onto the designated area. The suction was a different feeling but it wasn't painful - just a strong tug. Unlike a lot of reviews I've read, I didn't feel pain or much discomfort during the first 10 minutes. The only thing I noticed was that I was hesitant to breathe deeply because I would feel the tugging. I played on my phone for the whole session and time pretty much flew. I even took a few brief naps.\\n             \\n\\n             When the hour was up, the technician came back to massage the frozen fat. Initial massaging wasn't painful for me but near the end, it did start to feel like she was repeatedly rubbing over sunburned skin. Luckily, that burn started near the last 15 secs of the massage so it didn't last long. There was a lingering stinging feeling that lasted another 5 minutes afterwards but again, was uncomfortable but bearable.\\n             \\n\\n             After that, the treated area is just numb - much like how you go to the dentist and they freeze your mouth. Since I didn't feel much pain afterwards, I threw on my compression pants and went to the gym to train for an hour (grappling). No discomfort or pain whatsoever during that.\\n             \\n\\n             It's been 6 hours now and the area is still numb. I'm keeping the area compressed like a lot of others suggested to avoid any pain. So far so good.\",\n",

I went to ideal image - I had 6 sections of my abdomen done, 2 upper, 2 middle and 2 lower. I had the coolmax applicators on the bottom (the biggest one) and the smaller applicator on the other 4 sections. So 45 mins x 2 on the bottom, and 35 mins x 4 for the rest. I read several reviews having pain during the application. However, neither the suction nor the freezing part of the procedure caused me any pain - there is a period of small discomfort (2/10 on pain scale) when they start the freezing piece, but after 5 minutes I was numb and completely comfortable. This was the case on my entire abdomen. The pain piece cake with the massage after each section. The technician has to massage out the frozen area to maximize results - and this part hurt! I’m not going to lie - it was up there on the pain scale for me, and I’ve gone through kidney stones and giving birth. It is well beyond “uncomfortable” and I had to do it multiple times which may of course have made the pain level worse. This part was a 7/10 on the pain scale for me. However the massage only lasts 1-2 minutes and after it’s done the aftrpain goes away in about 5 minutes. After the procedure is over I was given the compression garment and I need it for sure. My belly right now is very sore and uncomfortable to touch. Sitting still I’m fine, but it is very sore to the touch. I will post again weekly/biweekly to track my results.',\n",

The first week or so, it was very swollen and I just dealt with it, knowing it would go away soon. Now, I'm starting to feel worried. All my jeans are tight and uncomfortable. I wore a dress today and looked a few months pregnant. I can't even suck it in like I used to. I haven't been super strict with my diet because we're in the middle of a move, but I haven't been pigging out either. My belly is also jiggly now where it wasn't before. I'm hyper-aware of the fat and can feel it when I run or walk fast. I'm hoping it's just the inflammatory process, but I was hoping I'd start to see at least minor results by now. Instead, I'm beginning to wonder if this was worth it.\\n             \\n\\n             Has anyone else experienced this? Will it get better?

I'm not badly overweight and I try to eat healthy and exercise/run regularly, but I have high carb-eating habits and have always been 'soft'. I'm 169cm tall (I think that's 5.54 in feet and inches). I lost 6kg last year and at best weighed 62.5kg (138lbs), measuring 69cm (27inches) at waist, 73cm (28.7) at lower belly and 93cm (36.6) at hips. However over Christmas I've gained something back (I'll give my starting measurements below).\\n             \\n             My lower belly and flanks are the stubborn areas that even at my skinniest there has always been a bulge visible through the shirt. I always find myself demotivated, after having lost all this weight and looking great in the upper body (well, except for the boob shrinkage-droopage that always comes with my weight loss....), my lower body is still full of fatty lumps and pumps. I feel like I'd need to become entirely flat-chested if I would like to have a nice lower body that fits in dresses and doesn't poke through the shirt. I don't want that! I want a balanced, natural distribution of weight ...pwease!\\n             \\n             I have done lipo about 10 years ago at a cheap and poor Estonian clinic, which left my inner thighs uneven, and my flanks looking a bit funny (not too bad, but kind of flat-shaped). It helped a bit (I used to be much worse), but not perfectly. I didn't have the courage to do the tummy at the time.\\n             \\n             Anyway, here are my starting measurements! (22 Feb 2017, morning): Weight: 69.3kg (152.8lbs) / Waist: 74.2cm (29.2 inches) / My lower belly (my 'bulge' + flanks): 94cm (37 inches) / Hips: 99cm (39 inches) / Left and right thighs: 60cm (23.6 inches) (I am measuring my thighs also because they are a good indicator of my weight loss: at my lowest weight they measured 56cm - translating to about -1cm / -0.6kg weight loss)).\\n             \\n             I will post pictures as well, don't worry. ^_^ I'm terrified about the famous nerve pain and not being able to run for a while, but I hope everything goes well... With a 82% positive rating in RealSelf, it cannot be total bogus, right?? (right??) :))\\n             \\n             Will write again tomorrow after the treatment!\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Ok, so here comes my first update!\\n             \\n             So today I had my initial consultation with a lovely young aesthetician at Barry's clinic in Edinburgh, who despite her youth was very professional and knowledgeable.\\n             \\n             I decided to buy a CoolSculpting package for my flanks and my lower and upper tummy, as well as my back under the bra. The procedure will be done in three sessions: today was my first - a sort of a test round, with just one cycle on my lower right belly (for lack of time we couldn't do both sides today). Next week I will have the last three cycles on my lower and upper belly (around 3-4 hours of treatment..), and the week after that my flanks and back (6 cycles, 6-7 hours).\\n             \\n             I've added some of my 'before' pics from yesterday, as well as pics of my right side of my tummy few hours after the treatment. As you can see, it's red, misshaped and heavily bloated and bumpy, but there's no bruising.\\n             \\n             Rewinding to the actual treatment:\\n             \\n             She put the cold and wet protective membrane on top of my skin, before the applicator (a medium-sized applicator). The actual sucking was not bad at all - sort of as you would feel if you grabbed your tummy fat very hard and pulled, and then twisted it with a bit of a 'Chinese rub'. It hurts a tiny bit and is uncomfortable, but not too bad. You will feel the cold within half a minute, and the first 3-5 minutes are quite uncomfortable (but still not too bad). After 5-10 minutes the area got numb and I felt nothing really for the next 50 minutes.\\n             \\n             Then comes the removal of the applicator, and the infamous massage. Outch! It felt horrible, really: I think I would have cried if I had had one of those large CoolMax applicators on, as even the medium-sized one on just one small area was awful enough. I didn't cry though. I got very cold all of a sudden, dizzy, nauseous, and clammy. I was wet all over with sweat, and thought I would pass out - but I didn't. After about 5min the worst was over, and 10 minutes after the treatment I was putting on clothes and feeling just fine - quite numb, actually, and slightly euphoric.\\n             \\n             An hour after the procedure as I was walking to the train, I suddenly felt very dizzy. I had to sit down at the closest place I could find, and suddenly the world started spinning around me. I got incredibly clammy-sweaty and wondered if I would pass out or puke, but I did neither. I was afraid I was going to miss my train, but I couldn't walk, as everything was spinning. It was the worst feeling ever. :( I've fainted twice in my life, and this was much worse. I've never experienced anything quite like it. But after about 10 minutes the feeling passed, and I was able to remember where I was going and to which direction - although still not quite well. I was dripping wet all over, having soaked all of my clothes, and regretted at not having brought spare clothes with me.\\n             \\n             I haven't had the nausea since, and the tummy has now turned very sore to touch (started at about 1-2hrs post-op). I barely managed to walk straight. If I sit still, I don't feel anything: no tingling, no pins & needles, no aching. If I move, or if I touch it, it hurts. I'm wearing extra supportive pantyhose and that helps. I'll take a paracetamol+ibuprofein+codeine combo tonight before bed.\\n             \\n             My next session is next Wednesday, when we will finish the tummy. It will be three cycles - yikes! I'm preparing with a spare change of clothes and an extra warm cotton jumper for those cold sweats that I know will break out. I will make sure to get to a train within an hour, before the first dizzy fit hits me.\\n             \\n             Any questions, don't hesitate to ask!\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Ok, so I had my second session three days ago, where we treated my upper tummy (two cycles), and the remaining left lower tummy (1 cycle), so 3hrs being sucked by that machine!\\n             \\n\\n             On the day of the session, not only did I have my full day of periods, but I was also suffering a second day of those dreaded 'nerve pains', which appeared on the 4th day after the first session and grew in intensity, being quite strong (pain level 6-7) on the days 5 and 6. It's actually NOT real nerve pain, even though some posts here talk about delayed onset neuralgia, because it doesn't actually affect the nerves. What this delayed onset pain is, is that it's the *fat cells healing themselves*. Imagine if you fell on asphalt and got very deep asphalt wounds, which then itch, throb and scab over the next days? It's sort of the same: I feel a deep itch which I can't stratch, coupled with feeling of sharp needle-like pains inside my tummy, and occasional aching. At times the sharp pains were quite intense (bordering on 7-8), but they passed quickly. Paracetamol + ibuprofein + codeine combo seemed to work, and I also put some Voltaren on my tummy a couple of times when the pain was becoming too annoying.\\n             \\n\\n             This delayed onset pain subsided in 2-3 days, and I have to say - because I had been very scared of this pain from having read horror stories in RealSelf before - that it really wasn't very bad for me. I have a very low pain threshold and I can honestly say, that it's not that bad.\\n             \\n\\n             Ok, so back to the 2nd session: so the three more cycles felt less awful than the 1st cycle I had had the week before, perhaps because I knew what to expect. I didn't get the awful clammy dizzy spell during or after the session, like I did last time. I managed to get home well, although I wouldn't advise driving or walking long distances: you really feel tired and sore, and you just want to get to your couch to tuck yourself in a fetus position as quickly as possible.\\n             \\n\\n             The next two days my entire tummy has been as tight as a bowstring: I haven't been able to properly stand straight, and I walk around my house like a Quasimodo. If I spend 5min gradually stretching my tummy, I'm finally able to stand straight. It's a bit like I did an utra hard ab exercises (x times 10), and my abs are just tight as a knot. The first nights I was very sore, but by the 3rd day I'm feeling much better.\\n             \\n\\n             The only thing is that I haven't been able to exercise since my 1st session, because my tummy hurts at the smallest jump or stretch. I can do most basic things, shopping, cleaning, picking up stuff from the floor, etc. but exercise, no way. I'm worried that my running fitness is deteriorating by the day, and feel a bit anxious to be able to go out and run again.\\n             \\n\\n             And I'm SO bloated! I look like I'm 3 months pregnant, it's insane. No bruising, no redness anymore, just tenderness and a non-existent baby.\\n             \\n             I'm also slightly worried about the delayed onset pain which will hit me in two days time, because the treated area is much larger now and the upper tummy is still very tight.\\n             \\n\\n             The aesthetician told me that the delayed onset pain is a sign that the fat cells are reacting, and it's a common and completely safe phase of the healing process.\\n             \\n\\n             In two weeks I have my last session, where we will treat my flanks. After that I am left with two cycles, which I can use in a few months time to treat an remaining areas I want to treat. I might do another cycle of my lower tummy, or do my upper back (bra area).\\n             \\n\\n             So far so good: I'm looking forward to the results in 1-2 months time!\",\n",

During the first 15 min, I became a little sweaty and nauseaous but I think that was from anxiety. I was able to sip on some water that I brought which helped. It is uncomfortable, but not painful. It took a total of two hours, and felt great when I left. Tory my technician was great. Everyone at Dr. Lopes office is amazing. I wouldn't trust anyone else. 12 hours later, feeling a tiny bit tender in some spots bur nothing major. I will post pics later to document results.

       " {'body': \"I have managed to stay slim and in pretty good shape but have always disliked the fact that my upper inner thighs touch. Skinny jeans and leggings just didn't look good so I decided that it was time to do something about it. I had seen ads for Coolsculpting and decided to check it out. I called Slim Studio on Roswell Rd and the staff were very helpful. They answered all my questions and I scheduled a consultation. The office is beautiful and Robbie and Smith were wonderful. They made me feel very comfortable, assessed my trouble area and told me I was a good candidate. i was glad to hear that and scheduled my treatment. I had heard certain areas can be a little uncomfortable but I found the inner thighs to be completely pain free. There is a weird tugging sensation when your fat is pulled up into the applicator and then you just sit and relax while the machine does it's thing. Afterwards, I had a tingling sensation for a couple weeks, kind of like when your hand goes numb and then the feeling starts coming back I only felt it when something lightly touched my skin but firm pressure felt good so I just wore yoga pants for a couple weeks. At 4 weeks out I started seeing results. My inner thighs weren't touching. The results continued to improve from there. I'm now 3 months out and love my results. No more touching thighs and my skinny jeans look great. Thank you Slim Studio!!! I will definitely recommend you to my friends.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Not sure what to think YET! Don\\'t expect me to post pictures, they aren\\'t pretty. You see, I\\'m 50+/menopause 2 years now. For YEARS I was fit and trim, then aging and sagging happened. Active Senior that looks like a Senior. I am NOT a hot mama jama and I watch what I eat and do. Fit bit contest with my friends so I always put in 15+K steps per day... Not super fit but not a slouch.\\n             \\n             I had Liposuction performed in 2013 at Sono Bello in Woburn, MA and it was a $5K dumped down the toilet. The worst part was that not only did my gut come back, but it brought back cousins, my cholesterol changed and not for the best (thanks to the fat that now goes around my organs...) despite relatively clean eating, AND a very uneven belly as well as migrated fat gain everywhere.\\n             \\n\\n             Cool Sculpting vs Lipo, initial experiences:\\n             \\n\\n             a. Initial consultations/sales pitch: in both cases, you work with a sales person who is very enthusiastic about their job. At both Ideal Image (Shrewsbury, MA), and Sono Bello (Woburn, MA) you will be treated by amazing sales staff very knowledgeable (but sales people nonetheless). Normally woman, who understand the struggle, and why we have crisis that require us to put ourselves through torture to look a certain way.\\n             \\n\\n             b. Cost. THERE ARE NO CHEAP FIXES. If there are, you don\\'t want them. RUN. But if you factor in the cost and quality of your time, there is less \"down time\" with Cool Sculpting. So that is cost savings there.\\n             \\n\\n             c. Procedure. This is one of the biggest challenges. CS: I had 6 areas done with the new coolsculpting attachments, so I didn\\'t have the \"butter stick\" effect or the pain associated with the old procedure. Relatively painless. Some areas a bit more discomfort than others, but not pain. The procedure was SUPER BORING. I was there for 3.5 hours with 35 minute intervals to grab my upper abdomen bra roll, sides and bottom. Brought lunch, a book, work. The procedure was virtually painless. Discomfort, but not painful. Minimal discomfort. The worst part was the upper massage, because of the little distance between my ribs and fat so it was sore. But very manageable. The process is MESSY. They use a goopy material to keep the suction on, and it goes EVERYWHERE. No sedative, so you can drive yourself there and back. Easy but messy. They should have the courtesy of a bathroom shower.\\n             \\n             Lipo: requires mild sedation. You are aware the entire time. Requires a real plastic surgeon to perform the procedure. You are awake when you are being bumped around. Need a driver to go home. You will be out of it. And for a good reason.\\n             \\n\\n             d. Post procedure day 1:\\n             \\n             CS - I left the procedure, came home, and went to Zumba in the evening. I put on my compression garment that night. I normally Zumba 3-4 days per week, weights 2 and yoga 1.\\n             \\n             Lipo: Go home and sleep while you can.\\n             \\n             Day 2\\n             \\n             CS - I\\'ve been working and practicing my zumba routine. I almose zero bruising but look preggo. Staff is adorable. They call the swelling \"inflammatory process\"...\\n             \\n             Lipo - OMG! You are in PAIN. A lot of it. And you can\\'t get back to daily routine with any ease whatsoever. It was a good month before I could bend over without feeling my gut being ripped. Not a fun recovery. VERY BRUISED, black and blue. - But it goes away. Forget sex. It will not work.\\n             \\n             Saga will continue...',\n",

As I said on day 1, I left the procedure, went home and cleaned, then I headed over to my Zumba class. Day 3, I just feel like I got punched a couple times, but only if I touch it.\\n             \\n\\n             I have a 2 hour Zumba fund raiser, and as long as I am wearing a compression garment and my jiggly stuff isn\\'t bouncing around, its 100% fine.

My root canal hurts far more!\\n             \\n\\n             Lets hope that it continues on this path and that I see results.

They didn\\'t take measurements. When I did lipo I weighed 152, but then had some weight gain (158). Before lipo my waist was 35 inches. 6 months after lipo went down to 29, and weighed 150. I am now down a bit again, my goal / target weight IF possible is 135-140, I\\'ve been on weight watchers for a year and recently weighed in at 146 (but I\\'ve had water retention). My waist is currently (before the treatment) 33 inches. I don\\'t anticipate ANY weight loss as a result of the coolsculpt.\\n             \\n\\n             So there you go. This is where I am at day 3. Just cleaned the house, practiced a couple of my routines and getting ready to head out the door for a 2 hour Zumba marathon with have of my face pounding thanks to a root canal yesterday (maybe I can\\'t feel my belly pain because my mouth hurts! HA!)\\n             \\n\\n             Numbness on the skin, but it doesn\\'t freak me out. I have a hip replacement and 2.5 years after I am barely regaining sensation in my leg.

       " {'body': \"I had cool sculpting done because my outer thighs were very asymmetrical and I wanted a tighter stomach and flanks. If I only would have listened to my husband and waited for real liposuction I would be a much happier, wealthier person! IT DID NOTHING!!! They try to hype you up, with before and after pics which still didn't show much of difference. They make you stand back further and anyone whose close up always looks bigger then further away, and also didn't make me wear their string garments which also show more skin more fat, so with my own underwear which is thicker covers more area naturally covers more skin hiding flaws. Even after I had it done I lost ten pounds and didn't see a difference. Now its May 2016, I made my consult for real lipo..which I know will have proven results! WASTE OF MONEY! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! To be fair, I only had one treatment, but to get 2,3, treatments...go for the real thing where you know they are SUCKING OUT THE FAT!!!! Recovery from lipo is not bad at all... I can return to work the following day!! So don't let them talk you into how lipo is a major surgery like I was told..its not!\",\n",

Even at my smallest 148lbs I still had love handles (more to the back vs hanging over the sides) and saddlebags.\\n             \\n\\n             After our recent move to Cali, I'd been gaining a little weight so I started looking for options. I am scared to death of needles and pass out all the time so regular lipo or smart lipo isn't a good option. Also I can't take time off from work right now.

She was so nice and spent tons of time with me making sure she knew what I was going for. Total treatment cost is $5,120 but that's for two applicators on each love handle and one applicator on each thigh. All that-times two sessions. I'm actually doing the treatment as I write this.\\n             \\n\\n             Applicator doesn't hurt at all, feels like putting a shop vac on our skin. The cold isnt bad either. Honesty I've been playing candy crush and snoozing on and off. The stick of butter was present and she massaged it out. That part isn't comfortable but it doesn't hurt because it's totally numb. The only pain is after the massage for about 2 minutes.\\n             \\n\\n             Listen, I don't have ANY pain tolerance and this didn't hurt at all. I did get nauseous and almost pass out after the first treatment when I got up to use the bathroom but I pass out regularly (like watching my friend get a piercing and one time when I stubbed my toe..:/)....

I went to MD Skin & Vein in Hunt Valley, MD to get a consultation on the Cool Sculpting procedure. After the consultation I thought to myself....why not give it a try? I don't want to lose more weight just get rid of the pockets of stubborn fat. I'm so glad that I did! I am very pleased with the results of the right and left flank areas of my back; as well as the top area of my left hip/thigh. My left hip/thigh was larger than the right, (obviously asymmetrical.) All three of these areas really bothered me. I may possibly go back for one more treatment to the flanks just to completely dissolve the fat there.

The first few minutes of having the device on me was pretty uncomfortable. After about 8 minutes I was 100% numb so it was fine!\\n             \\n             I had an hour of just relaxing, and actually planning future travel plans! Selika did the treatment for me and she was SO accommodating. She made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. I was cold (Go figure, it is CoolSculpting) but she provided a blanket that just made me feel perfect and cozy! I could have even taken a nap.\\n             \\n             After the hour of sitting there it came time for the massage. This definitely took my breathe away as it was really intense! Selika talked me through it, reminding me to breathe which really helped. My hip was a bit stiff since I was in this position for such a long time. I did stretch and it was time for the second treatment. Which was basically the same.\\n             \\n             After my treatment was done, I wore spanx to help keep me together. This did feel good since I was numb, things felt very strange. My numbness lasted for about a month. I did not have any post treatment pain, which I was nervous about. I did some times have a deep itch, but it was not unbearable.\\n             \\n             I took my photos a month later and was amazed at my results. I did not feel entirely different, but pictures do not lie! I started seeing a slimmer inner thigh on me! Which was really exciting because with all the exercising I've done, and not seeing much improvement on my inner thighs, this just amazed me!\\n             \\n             I had my second session done on October 19th and the treatment seemed to be a bit more intense. I was told it's because there is less fat. I also noticed that the numbness felt significantly less than it did in the first treatment. That was a relief as that numbness annoyed me. I was able to get back to my daily activities right away, and still have not experienced any post treatment pain! I am really excited to see how my next post pictures will be! I want to do this on my abdomen next. The results from the treatment and how accommodating Selika and the office was out weighs any discomfort!\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Hi there,\\n             \\n             I have had a really positive experience so far, and after being terrified by the intense experiences others have had on here I thought I would post about my positive one (so far)\\n             \\n             Through exercise and diet I had gotten down to about 118 lbs and had a very muscular stomach that I was very proud of but I didn\\'t like what the weight loss did to my chest. I am now back at my natural weight (125-128) and after about a year of reading about coolsculpting I went in for a consultation. I feel good and know that my stomach and flanks are in good shape but I want that last 5% to got to get into excellent territory. I am a performing artist and need to fit into leotards and such, even a little bit of pooch shows up in the costumes I usually wear. I want the muscular look that I had before without sacrificing my natural breast size. Anyhow thats how I ended up looking into this treatment.\\n             \\n\\n             I initially went to Artful Aesthetics in Montclair CA and was told I would need 10 cycles at $7000. I pondered this thinking that is a whole lot of money and cycles. I thought about it for a while and went to 77 Plastic Surgery for a second opinion. There they recommended only 3 for $1700. Much more manageable! I had never done any kind of \"procedure\" before so I was mostly concerned about the nerve pain that so many others experience. The woman who consulted with me and performed the procedure acknowledged that it does happen, she estimates about 15% of patients.\\n             \\n             She said that she recommended that I have the coolsmooth applicator used on my abs since she hadn\\'t had a single patient experience the nerve pain with it.\\n             \\n\\n             The procedure itself was easy. Yes, it was cold and uncomfortable for 10 minutes then the most irritating thing was staying still. I watched 30 rock and laughed way too hard, then got nervous that the laughter would dislodge the applicator and so I just read the news. The massage was weird but not horrible. I read tons of reviews and saw many with more negative responses so I felt prepared for the worst and had a really easy experience. As I thawed I actually felt a little sore (like old bruise feeling) no bruising, just a few little tiny hicky like marks. I went straight to work in a great mood.\\n             \\n\\n             Next two days were unremarkable, the expected numbness and odd jiggly feeling. I hadnt been exercising for about 2 months due to an injury so I did not begin exercise immediately. I did go on a 10 mile hike/jog on day 5 that didn\\'t effect the feeling of the treated areas.\\n             \\n\\n             Day 3-7 I had minor twinges from time to time, nothing bad, I mostly worried when they happened because I was expecting the feeling to get worse for a while. There was a bit of soreness that would come and go but the ache/twinges never rose above a 1 or a 2 level of pain. Minor itching, not even annoying.\\n             \\n\\n             I am on day 13 now, looking the same but I know not to expect anything for at least another 2 weeks. Plus I am about a week away from starting my cycle and know that this is not the time to compare the before pictures (when I was ovulating and looking my natural best...)\\n             \\n\\n             I will update as I start to notice changes, or after 4 months if I don\\'t notice anything.',\n",

Anyone who went to this seminar would receive 20% off the procedure if purchased that same day. The presentation basically went over the same information that I read on the internet so I didn't learn anything new; however, I did get to see a live demonstration where someone was actually having it done in front of us. After the demonstration, I was able to meet with a nurse who evaluated the locations that bothered me that I may want to have coolscuplted. She put these little measuring things on my belly area to see what size suction cup would be used during the procedure. I required a large one for the lower ab area and smaller cups for any other areas I was curious about. The area that bothered me the most was the lower ab so I decided to make an appointment to have that done in a few weeks. I would have liked to have done more but it is not cheap. That one area with the 20% discount was $1100. I'll see how that goes before deciding to do other body areas. I will write more once the procedure is done.\",\n",

Many recommend getting one to ice your belly when it starts to hurt because nothing else seems to help other than pain meds. I think I might buy one just to be prepared for pain if I get any.

She then gave me a soft pillow and put a blanket on my legs. The gel pad was then placed on my tummy. It felt wet and a little cold but not bad. The Coolsculpting machine was then aligned with the marks on my belly. I was nervous. She told me to take deep breaths. She pressed one of the two buttons on the head of the machine. That turned the suction part on. This was the part that was the most uncomfortable as it pulled my fat into the chamber to be frozen. It felt like a pull and pinch. Once I got over the initial shock of this action it was okay. She then pressed the second button which turned on the freeze part. It felt warm at first then like a massage then cold. I got used to it quickly. I'm now 45 mins into my treatment. Nothing is bothering me other than I need to use the restroom as I've been drinking water. Oh. I forgot to mention, it was hard to breath at first so I was taking shallow breathes but I got used to the suction and was able to return back to normal breathing. I'm excited for this to be done. Got less than 8 minutes to go. The nurse just checked in and said she's gonna do a massage on my belly after the machine is removed. I'll write more soon and post photos, too!\",\n",

I would rub or scratch it to relieve this feeling but no pain.\\n             \\n\\n             Last night, I woke up several times but I don't think it's related to the Coolsculpting. I had some spicy food last night and I'm having heartburn in my chest and slight stomach pain (maybe gas). It's not the part of the stomach that I had suctioned that hurts. It is in the upper GI part so again, I don't think it's related.\\n             \\n\\n             This morning I haven't had any pain. I just have a little discomfort from my pants against my stomach, which still feels bruised but doesn't have any bruises visible. Would be nice to wear pjs or sweats to work but that's not going to happen!\\n             \\n\\n             I'm anxiously awaiting to see if I get any pain that I've been reading about. It seems to happen between days 4-8 so I'm in that time frame right now. So far so good but we'll see. Fingers crosssed that I get through this pain free!\",\n",

I know it can take up to 3 months to see results so I'm trying to be patient. Here's the thing, I have off from December 21 - December 29. I am planning on having a breast augmentation during this time which would allow for plenty of recover time. Usually surgeons offer a discount if you get more than one procedure done at the same time. So, I'm considering lipo on my stomach area (the area I had treated and my flanks). Do you think I should not get the lipo and wait to see the results or do you think I should get the lipo because the results might be minimal anyway with coolsculpting (usually 20% decrease in size if that)? I just hate to think I wasted over $1,000 on coolsculpting when I could have used that for something else.\",\n",

While there, I asked to speak to a nurse about my coolsculpting and possibly getting lipo done. Unfortunately, all of the nurses and the doctor were out to lunch at the time I had my appointment. I sent an email to one of the nurses yesterday hoping to get an answer before I go in for my plastic surgery consultation today. I haven't had an answer back yet. I have gotten a few comments from realself friends about waiting to do the lipo. My three month mark for coolsculpting will be on 12/7. I had hate to not wait and then get lipo and not know the results of the coolsculpting; however, I would hate to wait and then get no results and then not have gone through with the lipo. If I get lipo, it would be on either 12/18 or 12/23. Maybe the plastic surgeon will allow me to make that decision later on after 12/7 if I wanted to do that or not as my main reason for seeing him is for a breast augmentation not lipo.... so if I booked an appt for BA maybe he'll let me add it on later. I'll ask today during my consult. I'll keep you posted.\",\n",

I feel like I wasted all that money that could have gone toward something else. Makes me mad really.

I decided to try Cool sculpting because a coworker loved it and got great results. Be prepared to sit completely still throughout your entire service (1 hour per section) bring cell phone /tablet to work on or surf the Web. First they lay a cool (cold) pad on the section to be treated to protect your skin from the cold. Then they place the machine over the marked area and the vacuum sucks your fat up into it, this pulls on the skin causing pulling pain on surrounding skin but only lasts for a few minutes. As the machine starts to cool there is a little discomfort but I didn't experience much, and it went completely numb pretty quick. 60 mins of looking at dog pics online later, the technician stopped the suction and removed the machine. Your skin does come out pretty gross looking and I didn't even want to look at it! They massage the area to warm it back up quicker which feels tingly like when you put cold hand under warm water. Some reviewers said this part hurts but my stomach was too numb to feel much. After a few minutes tho when the feeling came back it hurt so bad I also didn't want to do the other side! But that pain also went away in about 5 mins. After both sides I went home feeling tired, but not in pain. My skin on my stomach regained feeling in under an hour (good, no damage to the skin) but was numb underneath (good, dead fat). Today is day 6 and this is still how the area feels. The area has been sensitive but no noticeable swelling. Tissue under the skin has felt a but tight, but bearable. Yesterday, (day 5) the nerves really began to wake back up and Holy crap it hurts. The pain comes and goes and feels like little bee stings and is very sensitive to touch. I was told it isn't necessary to wear compression garments, but it does feel better during the day when I do. I normally tolerate pain very well, but did end up calling the med spa today to fill the prescription for pain killers they had offered me. Other reviews say the pain stops at about 7-10 days so I hope the pain goes away soon. Still no visible swelling so that makes me hopeful for some shrinking when it heals up. And I really hope so, so I don't have to end my review saying I spent a lot of money and pain for nothing...\",\n",

My doctor assured me that these situations were rare and he had not had any of his patients with those types of side effects.\\n             \\n             I am on day 4 and here is my experience:\\n             \\n             On Monday I went to the office and I knew what to expect because I had done my research. I had my lower abdomen done and they used 2 smaller \"paddles\", 1 on each side and it took an hour for each side. When the nurse put the first paddle on, I have to say that for about the first 5 minutes it was uncomfortable. It sucks your skin up into it and then it starts to get very, very cold. After about 5 minutes at the most, I adjusted to the feeling and I listened to music and read magazines. It wasn\\'t painful and was very tolerable. After an hour the nurse gently removed the paddle and warned me about my abdomen looking like \"a stick of butter\". It did, and it was pretty gross, so I didn\\'t look at it anymore! lol Then she had to massage the area to flatten out the \"stick of butter\", that part was painful. Not terrible, but it felt like I was badly bruised and someone was pushing on the bruises. Just very sore, but bearable. She massaged for a minute or two and then I went to use the ladies room before she put the second paddle on. I did feel a bit \"off\" when I got to the ladies room. I felt dizzy and started sweating, but in hindsight, I shouldn\\'t have got up that fast and my stomach was still sore from the massaging. About 5-10 minutes after the massaging, I felt fine and that side of my stomach didn\\'t hurt anymore.\\n             \\n             Then we did the other side. Pretty much the same. This time I knew the first 5 minutes would be uncomfortable but that it would pass. After the hour and the massage, I knew to just stay put and lay there for the 5-10 minutes and again the pain passed. All and all none of it was unbearable and I would say that I would do it again.\\n             \\n             Day 1: My stomach was sore and numb. It felt bruised (though it wasn\\'t) and extremely sore if I bumped it or touched it. So, I wore low fitting pants and took it easy. it also seemed pretty swollen and bloated. Actually, bigger than before the procedure! LOL\\n             \\n             Day 2: More of the same, nothing worse. Just sore and numb. I wore a sundress to work and tried not to touch or bump anything into my stomach.Still pretty swollen.\\n             \\n             Day 3: A little better. Still numb, but not quite as sore.Still pretty bloated looking.\\n             \\n             Day 4: Still numb, but even less sore than yesterday and I am seeing less swelling. It is starting to flatten out some and I am thankful for that!! LOL\\n             \\n             Anyway, all and all its going pretty good. I researched and knew what to expect. Almost backed out after reading the reviews. I know i need to give it time (up to 3 months) so thats exactly what i am doing. I am approaching day 5 and hoping those pains don\\'t start. but, I haven\\'t had any yet and all and all i feel better everyday. We shall see.\\n             \\n             I will update in a few days and let you know.',\n",

I was also exercising and watching what I ate. I did loose 4 inches in then abd area, but I believe it was due to working out 3x a week w a trainer and swimming 2x a week. I had a total of 24 treatments which cost $12,000 and I feel like it was money wasted. I was guaranteed that I would have results within 6 weeks, when I had none I was told by the staff this doesn't really start woeking until after 4 months! Well it's been 7 months and still no results! I should have been leary when the doctors office wouldn't give refunds if it didn't work! If you want permanent results you need to have liposuction! This is a very painful rip off. The treatments lasted one hour each and the pinching was excruciating! The doctor told me I would need 3-4 treatments in he abd area but I wasn't about to waste several thousands of dollars again, especially since it didn't work in 3 treatments! I would NEVER recommend this to anyone!\",\n",

       " {'body': 'So I went in today for the procedure, They did 3 of the \"max\" suction devices in a triangle type pattern on my stomach. Each took an hour. They took before pictures and then I had to change into some paper undies and shorts, and bra and sit on the table. The device sucks in the area, it was about 3 inches wide and about 12 or so inches long so it fit almost all of my stomach area each time. The suction is uncomfortable, its like pinching of the fat with a sort of huge clip. It starts to turn cold and for about 10 minutes it was uncomfortable, cold, and pinching me. And then it was frozen numb, and I could finally move and get out my phone and tablet and surfed the net for a while. The next part was removing the suction after an hour and they had to massage my skin because when it comes out it is a huge block of ice! That part was the most uncomfortable. I squirmed and fidgeted for 3 minutes while they aggressively massaged and the skin was so tender to the touch. Then they repeated the process this two more times! It took the wind out of me and I left ok, not hurting just sore. We went to have some lunch and then walked around the mall afterwards and I started to feel lethargic and sore. Every move I made I could feel my stomach move. i ended up falling asleep in the car (we drove an hour out of town for the procedure) and came home and layed down for a while. Compression gear helps a lot. Having my stomach held in makes it more comfortable and now I feel sore, as if I did hundreds of ab workouts yesterday and Im feeling the after of it. I am hoping this will taper down, I purchased ice packs in case it starts to hurt later. Its kind of hard to move around so I\\'m resting today, and I don\\'t even attempt bending over, ouch!\\n             \\n\\n             I will update with before and after pictures and update as often through the next several weeks.',\n",

I did work on my laptop and even hopped on a conference call.\\n             \\n             The post treatment massage was odd-but not painful. I left feeling odd walking with a sensation of two big lumps of numb skin inbewteen my legs but nothing else. Went back to work.\\n             \\n             The next day was the 'worst' if you could call it that. Some mild tenderness to the touch or when sitting down. Not unlike the day after doing a lot of lunges at the gym.\\n             \\n             Since then I've had no swelling or bruising. Maybe some slight pins and needles or tingling feelings that pass as quickly as a sneeze. Nothing that would make me take an ibuprofen or to wake up. I dont want to jinx myself and have the real discomfort kick in a week later but I feel pretty safe. I confirmed w the dr that just becauise i did have any sweeling or bruisng that teh treatment was not effective but he assures me that's not the case.\\n             \\n\\n             Clearly, I can not say if the treatment was successful-it is way too soon for any evaluation-or if the treatment was worth it. I just wanted to write this to add another experience regarding pain and recovery since there are so many dramatic and offputting stories here. Everyone heals differently and have different levels of pain tolerance. I would say I have a pretty high level myself. But keep in mind that if your only reason for not having CoolSculpt is the fear of possible pain during recovery, you would be in 1000% more pain with another fat removal procedures like lipo.\\n             \\n             I will try to post a follow up in 3 months regarding results.\",\n",

I am now impatient and tired of the way I look with no clothes on. I have been checking Real Self for years contemplating getting this done. Just like the rest of you, I have read ALL of the horror stories about the severe nerve pain after day 4 and it scared me out of it a few times until I finally said \"Screw it, I want this stomach fat gone. I\\'ll deal with the pain like a champ\".\\n             \\n             I went to Ideal Image in Allen Park, MI and they made me feel extremely comfortable. They took my before pictures and got me hooked up. First, they apply this slimy, cold gel barricade on the area then apply the applicator. I got the left side of my stomach and right flank done at once..then the other side after. Now I got the CoolAdvantage applicators which are supposedly the newer ones. The suction cups are bigger than the older ones and requires less time. Mine were on for 35 minutes instead of an hour. And the hopefully good news is...there is supposedly no nerve pain with these applicators! That\\'s what made me come to Ideal Image versus the surgeons who did not use CoolAdvantage. Hopefully that is true and I don\\'t have much pain. It literally feels how you think it feels, your skin being sucked into a bowl. The uncomfortable part comes when they turn the cooling on. It gets extremely cold to the point it causes a burning sensation. It is very uncomfortable but it does not hurt. Eventually, you become used to it. Now here is the painful part, that dreaded massage. All the reviews were right, the massage is hands down the worst part. It seemed like the longest minute ever. The area is very cold and it did hurt a bit after the message but it does go away after 2-3 minutes. I feel pretty okay right now, my skin is red in the areas that were treated and they gave me a compression garment that I can wear. I will update you guys as often as possible! I\\'m excited!',\n",

I did talk to Ideal Image and they said that sometimes the results aren't as drastic as the first go round because there isn't as much fat to freeze. I lost A LOT of stomach fat from the first treatment so this was understandable. Ill post pictures until the 3 months are up but just keep in mind, I am a gym rat now so my results this time may be from that. Do I think the second treatment was worth it? No. But the first one DEFINITELY was!\",\n",

Then, we moved to the actual room to begin the procedure.\\n             \\n\\n             We started with my flanks first and then moved to my lower abdomen.\\n             \\n\\n             Flanks:\\n             \\n             I am smaller so it took several times for my fat to get sucked up and STAY in the applicator.\\n             \\n             When she placed it on my it literally feels like a giant vacuum. There was no pain, just the suction pressure. After about 5 minutes you feel like slight burning sensation. It feels like a slight rug burn and was very tolerable. That feeling lasted about 10 minutes and then a cooling feeling came over the area. She made sure I had pillows propping me up, my coffee/phone in hand and left me to sit for the 1 hour period. After that she came in, took the applicators off and massaged each side for about 2 minutes. I would say this is the most uncomfortable part, not painful...uncomfortable. The area is tender to the touch. Comparable to a bruise.\\n             \\n\\n             The area was pretty tender right when she took the applicators off...but only for about 15 minutes and then the pain subsided. I could walk and bend normally. The area was just really red, which faded as well.\\n             \\n\\n             Lower Abdomen:\\n             \\n             I did not have enough fat to use the same vacuum like applicator on my abdomen. So instead, I received a flat applicator that still freezes the cells, just does not suck them in. I experienced the exact same notions; rug burn, cold and slightly numb. That area took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. She came in and massaged the area for about 2 minutes as well. It was like modeling clay! She would move the frozen, clumped fat cells and they would stick like that for a moment before settling to normal. The area has the same tenderness for the 15 minutes after the applicator was taken off and was a dark red.\\n             \\n\\n             Afterwards...I got dressed, left with my 3 month post check up date, went grocery shopping, cleaned my house, meal prepped my food, got a physic read (heehee) and then to bed with no sort of pain relievers. BEST EXPERIENCE EVER. I did put a compression garment on right after, more to help me with my posture so I didn't bed too much.\",\n",

It's been around for a while, and I like being an early adopter (I did laser hair removal in 2000), and its spring and I have a belly that needs to be removed....NOW!\\n             \\n\\n             After seeing a clip on Dr Oz, and having lunch with a friend, we started talking about cool sculpting. The next day I found a place and they had a consultation time available that same night. I needed 6 treatments. The 2 cool max (large area) counted as 4 treatments for the lower abdomen, and 2 small treatments in my upper abdomen.\\n             \\n\\n             After gasping at the cost, I said F it, let's do it. 2 days later, I went in for the procedure. It's was a torture chaimber for 4 hours. The pain did not lessen after 10 minutes as described. It was torturous the entire time. When the nurse came in to massage the area after an hour, it was even worse when she lifted the evil suction machine off my stomach and massaged out the hardened stick of butter that was my fat. I grunted the entire time. Holy cow was it intense. But I didn't want to say how painful it was in case I am just a wus. But seriously, I can manage pain, but wow wow wow.\\n             \\n             When they first apply the machine they should tell you to hold your breath and get ready for some major suction. Wow. Incredible and intense. Not fun.\\n             \\n\\n             So for the next 3 days, I was numb but I could manage. Day 4, I was crying out in random spurts at work. Pain was starting. Day 5&6- I called in sick, but said I would use vacation time since this was an elected procedure. Afternoon of day 6, my friends convinced me to return to the place that did it. They were surprised I had pain. Said no one complains. The nurse there at the location was sympathetic, but there is not much they can do. I asked for the nerve blocker. It took 1.5 hours for them to contact a doctor (no doctor in the place) to perscribe Neurontin - a nerve blocker that should be available over the counter. I also have ice packs on my belly whenever I am home. My belly also is really swollen and red _it's on fire. I Scream out in my car - alone driving because of the f-in pain. I paid for this pain FYI. I paid....\\n             \\n             Day 7 - went for a 20min car ride. I had to pull over and get out of the car and just breathe. Every bump in the road caused unbelievable pain, and I had tears streaming down my face. The pain was increadible...... I spent that weekend in a mo-mo so that no fabric touched me - not a sexy look. I didn't want anything touching my tummy. I sprayed liodacane on it every hour. My friend brought me her c-section codeine pills - but that didn't even work. My boyfriend wanted to hug me but I screamed every time he got close for a hug. Even sheets on top of me hurt so I had my legs covered then another blanket for my upper half to leave my tummy exposed. It's so strange.\\n             \\n             Monday - today......I went to my own doctor. He prescribed a higher dose of codeine and lidocaine patches............not much relief. I am now self medicating with mass quantity of wine. Helps much more than anything else.\\n             \\n\\n             I'll be updating more - it hurts. I've done lipo before and there is no comparison. I'll go back to lips in a second since they put you to sleep and automatically prescribe pain meds.\",\n",

I had cool sculpting done 5 days ago (craziest thing I have ever done!!!). The treatment was with a small applicator on the lower part of my abdomen - one treatment on the right and one on the left - it took 2 hours total. The worst part of the treatment is when they pull the applicator off your skin - it looks like a frozen log and is incredibly painful when they massage it down for about 2 minutes - it literally took my breath away. I had / have swelling, bruising, intermittent pain and cannot even touch the area because it is so sensitive. I find it interesting that all the surgeons / doctors say it is very rare to have the above side effects. After reading a lot of reviews I am not alone and have found it is in fact incredibly common. I haven't had the Itching sensation yet and hope it doesn't happen to me. I have never written a review before on any product but want to make sure that people know it is not a pain free process and to make sure you don't have a weekend in a bathing suit planned post procedure. I haven't seen any results yet and am still swollen. Also, I gained 2 lbs...? I hope to report back in 6 weeks with fantastic results and to endorse the procedure. Best of luck to everyone!!\",\n",

       " {'body': \"As I get older I noticed my thigh gap diminishing! I have always been self conscious about my legs and wanted this problem area to be solved forever. I heard an ad for CoolSculpting on the radio and when I went in for consultation Rachel sold me on it! Travis performed the procedure and I've never looked back! Initially I was a little scared of the pain I would receive but Travis put me 100% at ease. The initial feeling is like when you're a kid and stick a vacuum suction on your arm- pulls your skin right up and then after about 7 minutes it went numb and I just read a book! After the hour of treatment was over, Travis timed me two minutes and gave me a massage to smooth out my fat that had been suctioned and frozen. This part felt weirrrrrd but not really painful! It has now been about 3 months and I could tell just after 1 month the difference. I do not regret this procedure and will continue to come back with other problem areas.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'Thank you to all of the other reviewers out there who posted about their experiences, you all helped me so much on my journey toward a better body! I am 37 years old, have 2 elementary school-aged children, and I am desperate to build up my body confidence. I am currently 149 lbs and 5\\'5\" tall. I would like to lose about 10 lbs but am finding it so much harder now that I\\'m approaching 40.\\n             \\n\\n              I decided to try CoolSculpting on my lower abdomen to get rid of (or at least decrease) the little baby pooch I still have from my second pregnancy. I have an athletic frame and have always carried extra weight around my hips and rear end, but never had a belly until after having my second child. The \"spare tire\" bothers me to no end! I eat pretty well and exercise daily, but to no avail. I am pretty wary of going under anesthesia in order to get a proper tummy tuck (and I don\\'t feel like I\\'m big enough to warrant surgery - I\\'d rather just have the pooch) so I figured I\\'d give CoolSculpting a try. My procedure was on Monday, 2 days ago, and it went well. I had one area treated, my lower abdomen, with the large attachment. The first 5-10 minutes was BRUTAL, the machine sucked up so much of my stomach that it felt like my organs were being suctioned too! After a bit, I got used to the feeling and started to go numb. I\\'ve read other reviews where people have actually taken naps, but there was no way I was able to go to sleep with that big thing attached to me - it felt like a small iceberg sitting on my stomach. After 60 minutes the esthetician came in and removed the machine and then massaged the area. For me, this was the WORST part of the entire experience. I felt very clammy and hot and almost vomited and passed out. But I made it through and after a few minutes I calmed down and was able to drive home. I\\'m now 2 days out and am not experiencing any internal pain yet, as I\\'ve read others start to feel around days 4-7 or so. What I am experiencing is pain when anything bumps into my stomach, so hugs from the kids, leaning over the counter to wash dishes, etc, really, really hurt. That\\'s been pretty easy to deal with though and I can tell that, even though my skin is very sore and tender to the touch, my insides are still numb. I\\'m already dreading what\\'s coming my way when the nerve endings wake up and the pins and needles start - I\\'m hoping that it goes by quickly!',\n",

There was no going back to my usual activities as they advertise. I was swollen and highly sensitive for days. Moving, bending over and any contact with the treated area was incredibly painful. The Tylenol and ice packs they recommend were like putting a band aid on a laceration to the bone. I should have had prescription pain killers but didn't and toughed it out. What sent me over the edge was the 5th day when the nerve pain started. Suffered that for over 25 hours before my clinic prescribed the nerve medication. It didn't take away the pain but it made it tolerable. My experience was not the norm at all, I know but there should be a pain management plan and discuss the what ifs with your practitioner.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I had cool sculpting done 3 days ago. I thought I would document and share my experience here for anyone considering this procedure. I had my lower abs and upper and lower flanks done for a total of six applicators used. I should mention that I workout 3-4 days a week and eat as healthfully as I can. I simply had areas of fat that just would not go away no matter what I did.....thanks kiddos and thanks to my mid forties! My abs were done using 2 applicators (one on each side) from the side of the belly button to right above my panty line (maybe slightly lower than this) done at separate times and done in a diamond pattern. He believes the results are much better this way than one applicator going horizontally. My flanks were divided into upper and lower treatment areas...although both areas were on my sides. Praying for no more muffin top and more of an hourglass shape. I was told to come wearing loose comfortable clothes and a sports bra since that is what you will need to wear when leaving. It started with a VERY cold gel like cloth being placed over the area. He then placed the applicator on the area which literally sucks up as much skin/fat that your body will allow up into the vacuum like device. I should mention there are 3 different size applicators (small, medium, large). Your body shape determines what size can be used. I had medium applicators used in all areas. Once the fat is sucked WAY up in the machine, they turn on the freeze function and you remain with this on for one hour. This is very, very uncomfortable (not painful though) but only for about 5 minutes or so. Since I went to a place that has 2 machines, they could dual sculpt which cut my treatment time in half (3 hrs instead of 6)!! Once the hour is up, the suction applicator gets gently pulled off. Your skin/fat looks like a large stick of butter. It is a block like shape. This is where the pain enters into the procedure. It is extremely important that the treated area gets aggressively massaged. I am not going to lie.....this hurt like hell!!!!! The area is very tender and, in my case, bruised, and the critical massage lasts around 2-3 minutes. By far, the hardest part of the whole process. Since I was having multiple areas treated, my next round began with that initial 5 minutes of extreme discomfort coupled with the throbbing pain in the already treated area. No fun at all but.....THIS SUBSIDES!! Another 5 or 6 minutes later go by and, again, I am fine. I watched a movie during my procedure and they brought in lunch for me. They really did a fabulous job making me feel as comfortable as possible. I should also mention, I was in a hospital bed in a sitting up position with numerous pillows and even a boppy to support me and the machines. I have seen other reviews/videos where they laid the patient down. In my opinion, I can't see this working as well as sitting up. Na t urally, your fat and tissues retreat inward when lying down. So sitting up enables more to get pulled into the machine which is what you want to happen.\\n             \\n             When I was all done, they gave me warm wet towels to clean off all the goop. Not very easy to clean yourself at this point as your skin is extremely tender to the touch. I'm not sure how some people are able to go about their day after this procedure cause I was incredibly sore and swollen. I will post another post describing my first couple of days. Sorry for the length and if you are still reading this....I am happy to answer any questions I can. Good luck!!\",\n",

Today I did my first treatment and as much as you try to prepare yourself for something like this, once it happens you realize you were nowhere near prepared for the sensation the coolsculpting machine gave you. The closest I can relate it to would be like taking a bunch of wooden clothes pins and attaching it to your tummy. Ouch!

I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because the technician placed the applicator while I was still standing versus the first time when I was sitting but it was quite the relief.\\n             \\n             -I had the coolsculpting machine facing away from me this time so I couldn\\'t keep track of how much time I had left so I was flipping through the tv channels and playing on my phone so time went by surprisingly fast.\\n             \\n             -DO NOT chug so much water before the procedure! I felt like my bladder was about to explode by the 30 minute mark.\\n             \\n             -It was a good and bad thing that in my mind I kept reminding myself that the most painful part was the \"massage\" at the end so it helped me tolerate the previous pain but when it was time for it yikes!

It has been exactly one month post procedure and I can already start to see a little change in my lower abdomen area. I was told that i could start to see results as early as 3 weeks after but that most people do not see results until 2-3 months post, so this makes me happy. The procedure itself was a bit painful but only for short periods. The discomfort was from when they initially applied a very cold gelatinous paper onto the area where the vacuum head is to be placed. The second phase of discomfort came when they applied the suction, but that part was very brief. The procedure took a total of 2 hours. One hour each area, which was a little uncomfortable due to having to sit in one position for that long. The most painful part was when they had to do deep tissue massages to the area. Luckily the massage only lasted 2 minutes for each side. After the procedure the entire area worked on becomes numb and I continued to be numb for about three weeks after. It's been a full month now and I have regained almost 90% feeling back to that area, and was told that I would regain complete feeling in due time. I did end up having to take Motrin the first night after the procedure to help with the discomfort. The staff was wonderful though, doing their best to make me as comfortable as possible- offering me tea, magazines, an Ipad, helping me re-position when needed. I do believe I will continue to see results and hope to say that all the time and discomfort was more than worth it. The great thing is that it is noninvasive and there is no downtime afterwards.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I had my Coolsculpting treatment done in August and I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr. Brenner and the Coolsculpting team at Dr. Amy Brenner. I have that lovely tire around my abdomen from having my son last October and have been doing everything I can to get my body back post baby. Diet and exercise were not cutting it. I had a complimentary consultation at the office and the staff made me feel comfortable in an uncomfortable situation. At my consultation, it was determined I needed 4 of the bigger applicators. The first couple minutes were uncomfortable- it felt like an intense pulling and tugging; almost like a mammogram on your abdomen. Each time they place an applicator- you eliminate 20-25%, I wanted my abdomen flat! At my 30 day follow-up, I went ahead and scheduled an additional treatment (the same one I did before) for the next month. I am beyond thrilled with the results. I have dropped 2 pants sizes. I did have some late onset pain after my second treatment but sleeping with a heating pad helped. Dr. Brenner wrote me a prescription for a nerve blocker but I didn't find it necessary to take it. I like that both of the Dr's are hands on, they see you at the consultation and on treatment day. From start to finish, I had the best experience. I am thrilled with my results and am going back to treat my arms! I would definitely recommend Dr. Brenner and her team for any Coolsculpting treatments you are considering.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"After careful research by reading several reviews, as well as my thorough consult, I decided to try the CoolSculpting procedure. It was somewhat uncomfortable when they put the applicators on and I then waited comfortably after going numb while the procedure did its thing. I had a total of four procedures today, each individually done; my upper and lower abdomen, and the flanks and love handles. Lots of area tty o grab..After the numbness wore off and 8 hours later, I am now beginning to feel severe cramping or gas and occasional stabbing or burning sunsations in my lower and upper abdomen. I'm taking Tylenol and lying in bed.\\n             \\n\\n             I highly recommend anyone having this procedure research it thoroughly.. it is not a weight loss program or painless by any means. I also expect some down time as I feel like I've been kicked by a horse. The best advice I can give is to wear very form fitting spanks or shape wear around the areas you have treated as this will help minimize the discomfort. I hope the pain does not intensify beyond what it is now as I'm cramping in my middle abdomen area and it seems to be getting worse, accompanied by a growling stomach, but I'm afraid to eat. I've only had lettuce wraps and water tty oday. DRINK TONS OF WATER AFTER THIS, AVOID IBUPTOFIN AND USE TYLENOL IF YOU'RE ABLE.\\n             \\n\\n             Occasionally I'll feel the pins and needles or maybe little tiny seizures as this is obviously a shock to your system. The good news is I'm pretty sure I'm thawed by now as its been 8 hours from the time I left the building. I just hope the pain that I do experience (occasional stabbing in my lower abdomen) doesn't get worse as I read the many reviews. It isn't frequent and is localized, lasting a few seconds and then going away for a bit. I'm also experiencing some mild itching in my upper abdomen on occasion. I think that's a good thing. If the discomfort gets worse, not sure how I'm going to deal with it. I also wonder if i should massage the treated areas. For now, I'm taking a sleep aid and calling it a day. I have 25 lbs to loose and this is my jump start. Sure hope it wasn't a waste but no way am I going under a knife or having smart lipo (lasar), which I hear is far more painful than this and less noticeable as far as results go. Will continue to post updates. Oh, I'm very bloated and swollen. Here is a pic of my stomach and then the other picture is what I'm wearing for compression..helps tremendously.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Umm...ya. yesterday was rough and I gave serious doubts that this could possibly work. It was basically like a large waffle iron taking slabs of my pooch and fat rolls over the hips, squeezing it and sucking and cooling the skin to about 38 •F. So my muscles are very sore, I'm a bit numb where the looser skin is, and have bruising and a lot of swelling. My upper abdomen is hard as a rock. I hope the itching or random stinging or varying sensations means fat cells are dying. I realize this is going to be a long process. I took pictures today that I am posting and will probably do weekly updates just for my own peace of mind. I suspect that I may need to have one more treatment on the middle part of my lower abdomen around the belly button as that's an area they did not treat so having said that, coupled with my weight loss program and increased activity, I'm hoping it will all come together and I'll get a much nicer, toned look than what I currently have. Shame on me for letting it get like this but it is what it is ..thank God for my little compression girdle and tight tank top. it has been a lifesaver to wear at night and I noticed when not wearing it made a big difference. The pain, for now, is not as bad as some of the descriptions I've read where it was nerve issues. I don't believe I have any of that but it it's only been two days and right now I just feel like I've been kicked in my entire upper torso and sides with bruising and significant swelling. It hurts more where the fat was less..took 2 Tylenol today.\",\n",

Activities increase it because of the circulation. I talked with the therapist today. Said itching is common she also stated anyone wearing compression garments should heavily moisturize..was glad to hear that my instinct to keep a good moisturizer down there was recommended because I haven't read that anywhere. So thanks for dolliwing me.. I've never had any followers but I'm really looking forward to seeing if this works I have a wedding in August and I really want to lose 20 pounds and loose the muffin top which as you get older it seems to get harder and harder to lose even when you lose the weight so I'll be getting my office area on Tuesday and I am quite interested in seeing how that turns out I'm having my entire lower face done and I'm very nervous so she had to talk me down a little bit but I'm going to go for it.\",\n",

I did get the cramping after she massaged me (like she warned) she told me to get on the floor and cradle my stomach and it would pass in 9-10 min. I felt pretty stupid, but she was so right at exactly 9 min, it went away, besides a bruise feeling I have no pain. I did not start to see my results until 2 months, I know some people said they saw a change within 4 weeks. I started noticing a change in my clothes, then when I saw my pre & post pix, I could not believe it! I am amazed! I have scheduled my second treatment and now considering treating my flanks!! I had consulted with a doctor in the Severna Park area, a doctor never even spoke with me I was a little uncomfortable with this treatment being done not by a doctor, however Marie was great she was a nurse not just a \"technician\" like the other facility.

       " {'body': 'I kind of got talked into this by a friend who wanted CoolSculpting. My daughter is getting married in early June and diet and exercise alone were not getting me where I wanted to be!\\n             \\n\\n             We went in for a consultation, and at first I was leaning towards Laser Liposuction. (I am 5\\'4\" and 148 lb., so 15 or so lb. overweight. I exercise but menopause has also thickened the waist.) But after reading more about that procedure on this site (thanks!), I decided that while lipo might have gotten me more dramatic results, I was really uncomfortable with the recovery time and potential for edema, etc.\\n             \\n\\n             I went in on Friday, March 18 and had 4 areas treated: low flanks and love handles. I have to say, 4 hours is a long time to be hooked up to this machine, even with quick potty breaks at the end of each treatment. The procedure itself was not as painful as some people described, but it also wasn\\'t easy-peasy after the first 7 minutes as other say. I felt intense tugging the entire time. The massages afterwards were not pleasant, but weren\\'t dreadful. Each area started to swell up as soon as the treatment ended.\\n             \\n\\n             I had difficulty sleeping through the night because I am a side sleeper and my muffin top was pretty swollen and tender. The following day, my skin was numb but the tissue underneath was very tender. There was definite bruising. I upped my water intake and needed to urinate frequently - hoped that was a sign of flushing fat cells out!\\n             \\n\\n             Day 2: Slept better because I took 1/2 a hydrocodone tablet left over from a toothache. Anything around my waist was painful. Used a compression tank top to control jiggling, which was painful.\\n             \\n\\n             Day 3: Swelling at this point has added 1.5\" to the circumference around my hips.\\n             \\n\\n             Day 5: Woke up in the night due to side-sleeping on my tender love handles. Took ibuprofin, which I had been avoiding because somewhere I read that using anti-inflammatories interferes with this process. In the morning, I felt like I had turned a corner: swelling was down, didn\\'t feel that super-tender jiggling. Skin is still numb. My hips/low tummy circumference is back to where I started.\\n             \\n\\n             I will feel like this is working when that circumference starts to get smaller. They advised me to come back at 8 weeks for a second treatment on the same area but they said you don\\'t see the full results until 3-4 months down the road. So if I feel like this is working, I think will go back at the 4-week mark and have my lower abdoment treated.',\n",

I am still VERY tender where the applicator was placed, and still have a large numb area between my navel and c-section scar. After reading several reviews, I did purchase an at-home ultrasound device and use it every day, which I think has been the difference. I'll know better in four weeks if I will ever do this again.\",\n",

I don\\'t see that protrusion in my abdominal area that was there before and I haven\\'t even reached the 4 month optimal results mark. I actually don\\'t mind wearing a bathing suit. Normally I have trouble finding one that the bottom fits over my complete pouch, this year I didn\\'t have to worry about that. My abdomen probably needs another treatments, but I am COMPLETELY happy with what has happened so far and am looking forward to maybe getting my love handles done in August. WORTH IT!!!!\\n              \\n              I didn\\'t have a lot of pain, more annoyance and never once was I unable to sleep.\\n              \\n              My physician was wonderful and very helpful.

Just like everyone else, I experienced a lot of discomfort, especially when I wore my work pants. The pain wasn't anything unbearable for me. I didn't use any kind of pain medications; when possible I would just open my pants. Initially, I began to see my stomach go down and I was quite pleased. Just recently, I lost 10 pounds, and it seemed as if my stomach has enlarged. Even without the 10 pounds, I am still roughly in a size 10-12 pants, but i just can't seem to figure out why it appears that I have weight gain only in my stomach area. I feel like I’ve spent $1400 on virtually nothing. Maybe I was not the right candidate for this procedure and the doctor failed to explain that to me. Now my stomach is much larger than what I was before I received the procedure.\",\n",

Being discouraged about the weight gain but not wanting to undergo surgery again, I decided to give cool sculpting a try.\\n             \\n\\n             THIS IS NOT A PAIN FREE PROCEDURE. A week after having my abdomen treated I suffered from debilitating pain!! The feeling of needles pricking and across my whole abdomen area was so severe that I had to take several days off work. Putting ice on the area definitely didn't help because putting anything, even underwear on made the irritation and pain that much worse!! I actually woke up out of my sleep in tears two nights in a row.\\n             \\n\\n             Now, I don't know if it was too soon to receive another procedure or not but after undergoing CoolSculpting it seems as if my abdominal area got even bigger than it was before the procedure. Not only is the area larger, but there is no an indentation going horizontally across my belly and my upper abdomen looks lumpy and swolen!!\\n             \\n\\n             Needless to say, I am not satisfied with my results. I was trying to avoid another liposuction procedure,but it looks like I'll be back on the table again to repair the damages that have been done????.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"Had my tummy tuck in march 2015. super satisfied with results. now, 18 months later, I've noticed pockets of fat developing in love handle area that won't go away even with diet and exercise. a friend suggested I look into coolsculpting. had my consult on a Monday and scheduled my flank coolsculpt for the following Friday. the procedure itself took no prep. the process was simple save for the fact that the plan was to do both sides simultaneously and we ended up only being able to do one for reasons i'm still unclear on. (the machine detected thermal alarms twice and their policy was to not attempt a cycle more than twice. therefore, i'm returning a week later to finish up the other side.)\\n             \\n\\n             the actual process was easy. the tugging was uncomfortable at first. never really got the super cool sensation I read about. the worst part was the massaging afterwards. that made me cry out more than once. left there feeling great. the rest of my day was uneventful - no pain, no side effects. I even jogged 2 miles on my treadmill. the next day, I began to get a little achy. nothing too bad. sunday I worked outside all day and ended up having to take a couple of Tylenol before bed. Monday was worse. took Tylenol all day due to just an achy, cramping feeling in left side. managed a short workout that night, then iced it before bedtime. today, roughly 4 days later, i'm getting the tingling deep inside sensation. not painful, just weird. still taking Tylenol and icing it as we speak. the only thing I can compare it to is that once, as a child, I bruised a rib. it was a deep ache and sometimes hurt to take a deep breath. that is pretty much how I feel. don't like to sit too long because that causes it to pulsate a little. I find myself standing and stretching it out throughout the day.\\n             \\n\\n             *I would like to mention, the side that malfunctioned was my right side. the machine detected problems 20 minutes in the cycle had to be stopped. she thought the protective layer might have ripped. she replaced and started me over. again, it detected a problem and had to be shut off. this time she blamed it on my tattoo or the machine. she really couldn't give me an answer as to why it wasn't working. what was weird though was that my left, successful side - no bruising. the right, unfinished side, had a giant bruise almost immediately and it was sensitive to hot water afterwards. maybe it was a thermal issue afterall. I will return on Friday to retry that side.\\n             \\n\\n             my advice is to do one side at a time. it would be difficult to ice both sides at once and I feel like I'll get better results since they are focusing on one side at a time. pics to follow...\",\n",

They did the inner thighs first, one at a time. They suction the applicator on while you're standing up then you have to maneuver onto the chair. First thigh was totally painless - the cold was barely noticeable. I wasn't even sure if was attached properly until they took it off and I saw my frozen blob of fat. The massage did not hurt at all. The second thigh was a little more sensitive, but maybe a 2 on a scale of 1-10. The freeze time was 35 min per leg. The applicator on my lower abs was the larger one (newest version) and it was a little worse than the legs. I was never in pain, just uncomfortable. She warned me to stay very still so that the applicator didn't come off. By the end of the 45 minutes my butt was starting to hurt! The massage for my abs hurt for the first 30 seconds or so then it wasn't so bad. I was numb the first day and mainly hung around the house. We went shopping in the evening and it felt strange to walk with my inner thighs being numb. The next morning I went to boot camp class at the gym and had no issues.

       " {'body': 'This past March, I had Zeltiq Coolsculpting done on my love handles at Dr. Mountcastle’s office. I was pretty hesitant, because I’m a huge baby when it comes to pain. I can hardly stand needles, which is why I liked the idea of the coolsculpting so much. Even though I knew the procedure didn’t use anything sharp, I was still shaking when I went into the office, afraid that it would hurt.\\n              \\n\\n              When I first went into the office, the nurse had me change into a disposable thong and my bra, to keep me from getting my clothes dirty. She then took a bunch of pictures of me, which I really didn’t want to do at first. But then the nurse explained that the pictures were all anonymous and didn’t have my face in them. I could also decide to keep these pictures private within the doctor’s office. They just wanted to take the photos so they could compare the before and after pictures to see how effective the coolsculpting had been on me. I let her take the photos and it turned out to be totally worth it so I could see my own results.\\n              \\n\\n              The nurse then drew a couple of x’s on my body with a pen to mark where the machine’s suction cups were going to be hooked up. I laid down on my side on the bed and the nurse attached one of the vacuum suction canisters to my left love handle. She gave me a warning that she was about to turn the machine on and I braced myself for the pain. She turned it on and I could feel my skin being pulled sharply up into the suction canister. I gasped and yelped “Ouch!” but more because I was expecting pain than because I actually felt it. It felt uncomfortable for a minute or two but then the coolness of the procedure sort of numbed the area. The nurse handed me a remote to the tv they had in the room and a pager to contact her if I needed her anytime in the next hour. She left the room and I put a movie on Netflix. I started to watch it, but fell asleep instead. I guess the procedure wasn’t too bad since I managed to nap! After what must have been an hour, the nurse came back in and woke me up to disconnect me from the machine. Now that part actually did hurt. It felt like sharp little prickles in the area that had been treated as soon as she pulled the vacuum off of me. And as the numbness wore off, it started to feel less like sharp little pains and more like I had a big bruise on my love handle. Plus, my love handle looked gross. It looked as though it was disconnected from my body. Like a raw piece of frozen meat or something. I turned over to the other side and repeated the procedure on my right love handle. The right side was exactly the same as the left side.\\n              \\n\\n              When I got up to go home, it hurt just to button my jeans. It felt like I had run into a table corner with both of my hips. I also had pretty bad bruising on my love handle area.\\n              \\n\\n              For about the next week, I had tenderness and soreness and the bruises stayed there. After about 7 days, I stopped hurting and the bruises started to disappear. As soon as the pain and bruises disappeared, I started noticing a sort of tingling numbness in my love handles. I was concerned and called to ask about that. The front desk at Dr Mountcastle’s office said that was normal and would disappear after a few more weeks. It’s completely gone now and I feel back to normal.\\n              \\n\\n              It’s been about two months now and I can DEFINITELY see a difference. I went back to the office for a follow-up visit, where they showed me my before and after results. They said when I first got the coolsculpting that there would be a slight difference, but to me, it feels like a huge difference. I have never been able to get rid of my love handles because I don’t know how to work them out. This procedure did what I never seemed to be able to do. I feel so much more proportional and happy with my body. The whole experience was definitely worth the results.',\n",

The massage after wasn't fun, but nearly as bad as I was expecting. I was prepared for pain, and purchased an ice wraptor and extra ice packs, assuming I'd need them- but I never did. Days 5 - 7 I would experience slight pain (like a 3 on a 10 scale), that would last about 5 to 10 minutes. It was very localized- kind of like my pants were way too tight and digging into my stomach. But it wasn't anything that caused me downtime. The day after the procedure I was back to my circuit training and jogging- I just made sure I had on high waisted leggings! I am still numb in areas, but it's going away. The swelling seemed to go down by day 10 or so- but wasn't too bad- like I had gained a few lbs or so. I am small framed, and have always had a belly pooch- even when I was underweight at 100 lbs! I'm hoping the money on the ice packs is the only money I've waisted...I'll update in a month or so.\",\n",

I read some reviews saying how painful it was . For me I had very little discomfort. The most discomfort I had was when they had to message and even with that it wasn't so bad. The machine sucklng your fat felt like a heavy vacuum on your belly. You feel it for the first 5 minutes but after that you become numb. They did one area on my lower belly and 1 area on my back at the same time for 1 hr then they did my other lower belly area with the other back area. After that they did my right upper belly 1 hour then the other side 1 hour. Once they were done they told me I could get dressed and to put my spanks on for support. So far I feel fine I'm, some of the numbness is starting to wear off and I am swollen but the spanks is keeping everything from moving around. I will post pics asap and I will check back to let you know my progress.\",\n",

They even give me second treatment for no cost . Even after second treatment no changes at all. I waited for months to see results.

The procedure was not painful although there were some moments of post op discomfort All was managed quite effectively and the results were really great. The first few days I was very comfortable. After about 5 days I began to experience some slight nerve regeneration pain. By day 7 the pain was quite uncomfortable. I called by doctor and she made some natural recommendations for the pain and discomfort. I did not want to take pharmaceutical but preferred to stay with natural remedies. She was quite knowledgeable about what I could take. I followed her recommendations and the herbs she recommended worked. After that I had no more problems. The area seemed a little hard for a while but that too began to change. I believe I progressed as expected. I now have a flat tummy and no fat.',\n",

The gel pad was cold, and it felt like my sides were being squeezed but that was about it.\\n             \\n             After 3 weeks there was some small amount of fat loss.

I have always had shapely legs but stopped playing tennis 3 years ago due to an injury, and havent been working out (no time, right?) like I always had, and this spring I realized that I had bulges in my inner thighs! YUK! No thigh gap here!! You cannot get the fat off that area once its there! I live in \"short shorts\" or bike shorts but was not going to wear them this summer with the bulging inner thighs. The consultant said that I was a good candidate and I decided to take the plunge because something had to be done to get my legs back and I didnt want to have surgery. I signed up at Slim Studio and it was easy-breezy. On the right side, it was more uncomfortable, it was strong compression but only the first few minutes then I really didnt feel anything, I think the area got numb. The left side was not very uncomfortable, and I was out of there in no time. It took about 5 weeks and then my inner thighs began to shrink, I kid you not! After about 8 weeks, I was back to wearing tight black bike shorts!!! I am proud of my legs again and grateful for this technology. Seriously now I want to get my small but present muffin top Coolsculpted!! Fall jeans..... I definatley recommend this procedure!!',\n",

I tried norco's and I had to take 3 just to go to sleep. I finally came up with a plan, where i used cold compresses on my stomach during the day, and take ambien at night to sleep. I only work outside the house on the first week, I didn't go. on the second week I put on a waist trainer belt which in it self in painful, so I didn't really feel the pain of the coolsculpting. around day 11 i started to feel better. on day 13 i had a appointment to get my flanks done, which I almost didn't go to but I read reviews for people that had pain, and they said the flanks wasn't painful afterwards. so i went ahead with it. its been 2 days since I had the flanks done and im just able t touch me stomach with any pressure, and i feel lumps. uhhhh!!! i read more reviews and some people stated that they do not go away. they've tried several thing (you can search lumps/coolsculpting) I also did another search where some doctors admitted that some of their patients experience lumps but they went away after 2-3 months. im going to call my doctor to let him know tomorrow. i am so afraid this is permanent. Ive seen post where it says to message the lumps, so I will do that. stomach is still tender but I will endure the uncomfortableness to try to get them down. Im praying i dont get lumps on the flanks to... has anyone out there had lumps and has had some time pass? im on 2 weeks and a couple days for stomach.

       " {'body': 'After working out 4-5 days a week, eating as healthy as I could, I had just about given up. Yes, I had seen my body change but not like I wanted to- not until CoolSculpting. I always thought, \"This little belly is all due to genetics. There is nothing I can do.\" Never did I think being wrong would make me so happy!\\n             \\n\\n              Shawndelle at Beaty Facial Plastic Surgery was amazing. She really made me feel comfortable about the procedure and about the assessment. I admit, I was totally nervous to be exposed and show the area that I had been so unhappy with for years. Even in high school, when I weighed nothing and was made of muscle, I still always had this little belly. Shawndelle gave me an entire assessment of what areas I should treat. I was really worried that it was going to hurt or it was going to hinder me from the workout I had to do that evening- so I only did treatment on my lower abdomen even though she suggested my upper abdomen and flanks. I really wanted to see what the treatment was like before I committed to doing it everywhere. When the treatment began, I was pleasantly surprised at how much it didn\\'t hurt at all. After about 10 minutes had passed, I was sound asleep! The initial draw of tissue into the applicator was a surprise but nothing compared to what I expected. I think the gel liner on my skin before that was the most uncomfortable, but still that was nothing more than cold! After almost an hour, Shawndelle returned to complete a gentle massage and place the applicator on the right, lower abdomen. This time, I stayed awake so that I would be able to discuss my treatment. It was wonderful! I felt relaxed and comfortable.\\n             \\n\\n              When my treatment was complete, I was a little sore and did bruise a little bit. I was able, however, to do an entire leg workout that evening with squats, lunges, leg press, etc. All exercises that rely on stabilization of your core. Portions of the area felt numb for about 6 weeks but it was nothing I had not been warned of.\\n             \\n\\n              A few weeks later I was in the ladies room and noticed that my stomach felt flatter than I had ever felt. I came flying out in front of the mirror and turned from side to side like a little bird doing a dance! Never in my entire life had my stomach been so flat! Never had I ran my hands down my stomach and not felt that little belly bulge! But it was gone! Completely smooth and it looks amazing! Whomever said that your body is the best in high school had never heard of CoolSculpting! Because of this procedure, I have confidence I have never had, I will try on any dress, and I am nothing but motivated and determined to keep improving in the gym. I feel like I finally have a result that mimics the hard work I have put into my body!\\n             \\n\\n              The photos I provided show me at baseline, at two weeks out, and then at 4 weeks out. The area treated only improved more and more over the next 8 weeks. In retrospect, I wish I had followed Shawndelle\\'s assessment and done all the areas of opportunity at the same time. Since then, I have had my upper abdomen treated and my lower flanks. I am so happy with the progress and cannot wait to show you my full transformation photos!\\n             \\n\\n              Oh, and that cute little pair of shorts I wore in high school- they fit me better than they did then... but that style... you can\\'t CoolSculpt that into fashion!',\n",

Let me just say: this is NOT A QUICK FIX! Although I expected it, the swelling I had- feeling like I was about 3 months pregnant immediately then ever so sloooowly going down (it felt like forever!!!) was really hard! I had to make some major wardrobe adjustments to conceal my belly. That said, just now, and at the same weight I started, I am beginning to see good results and I like what I see. At this point I look a bit better than I did pre- procedure, and I\\'m told results can go on for two to three months total!\\n             \\n             I\\'m not going to into great detail on the process itself as I feel others have described it well. I did have some numbness and nerve twinges. I was given a Rx for GABAPENTIN for the nerve issues post- procedure and it helped a LOT- it also make you drowsy so it helped me sleep. My skin was very sensitive as well. I did wear high waist spanx for a week 24 hours a day. I couldn\\'t stand the feeling of clothing brushing up against my skin, it helped conceal a some of the swelling plus stopped the \"jiggles\". Getting them on and off was ouch, however!!! I was advised not to take anti-inflammatories as well, which was hard as I have arthritis. But I am stil refraining and using Tylenol.\\n             \\n             As to results. Not much difference in inner thighs... but was told that likely would take 3 months. Outer thighs, on the other hand, I am seeing some results already. My belly, as I would call it \"pinch a thick inch and a half\" when sitting, has gone down to a thin less than an inch (very unscientific, I know). Not where I want to be yet, but am hoping with more time it will continue to go down. Flanks are hard to say.i think less, but again, not as dramatic as my lower belly.\\n             \\n             As to resuming \"normal\" activity the same day that I have seen advertised: hogwash!! No way, at least with the 8 areas I had done all at once! I didn\\'t feel up to anything but low level activity for a week, then gradually better, with a outdoor woods 2 hour hike at day 10. I was a bit worried about that, but it was ok. I am now back to more routine rigorous exercise, hoping to lose that \"last 10\".\\n             \\n             I will continue to update...and if I have the nerve, post pictures (lol).

Recently I had an urgent situation and Dr. Kavali met me at her office before they even opened - I don't think there are many doctors that would do that! I am gearing up for a breast lift and there is no other plastic surgeon I would even consider!\",\n",

The suction was very uncomfortable and where I had more fat, the more discomfort I had. After 10 minutes, everything went numb.

At the end of the day, the procedure(s) were worth it, but let me tell you - the stomach one hurt like a mother about 1 week afterwards until day 14. The love handles didn\\'t hurt one bit - not at all.\\n             \\n\\n             I had the size 8 (largest) applicator on my stomach and apparently the skin around my stomach was stretched out from the two pregnancies. When the machine turned on, I felt like my entire stomach from my crotch to my boobs was sucked up into the applicator. The lady said I had a lot of loose skin. There was some numbness and slight bruising for about a week afterwards, but then the holy hell pain started. It was little stabbing pains, like needle pain, right along the \"Fattest\" part of my belly. The pain lasted for about 7 days then it went completely away. I had some codeine left over from when I broke my hand, and that seemed to help.\\n             \\n\\n             Surprisingly, I didn\\'t feel one ounce of pain during the procedure or anytime afterwards when I had my love handles done. I had a size 6 applicator that time; not sure if that makes a difference.\\n             \\n\\n             I would recommend this to anyone, but be aware that if you have your stomach done, you might be in for some pain. I didn\\'t expect any, and I was very surprised which I think was half the problem.\\n             \\n\\n             Three months out, I love the results.

       " {'body': 'Im 5\\'3\" 125#. I\\'m pretty fit everywhere-except for a few areas which I feel I have \"pockets\" of fat that never seem to go away no matter how intense my training is. I have a clean, healthy diet, I limit my amount of processed foods & do cardio/weights 5-6 days a week.\\n             \\n             Had several consultations for lipo of inner thighs over past few years. This area has always bothered me since high school & never seems to diminish or get better in anyway. They touch, and this has made me self conscious in a swimsuit. My stomach is flat-thighs & upper arms are really the only areas I would say I truly have \"stubborn fat.\" Every time I went to get a consultation-the surgeons officd would always try to upsell me on other areas, try to add a boob job, etc... The cost I was quoted was usually around $5,000-$6000 , but they always seemed to want to do more areas or add things and I literally came SO close to doing it like twice-scheduled the appointment & everything but then always cancelled. The downtime was just too much for me and I hate being under anesthesia. When I heard about coolsculpting-I instantly knew I had to do it!!!\\n             \\n\\n             I went in for a consultation. Sadly they said my thighs were really the only area with enough fat to do coolsculpting. I know I say \"sadly,\" but I guess this is a blessing. They pinched my thighs and said I was a \"perfect candidate,\" lol... As for my arms which I wanted done, they said there isn\\'t a handpiece for your arms yet? They said they thought doing arms was too risky, and in the past they had tried to attach the piece to people\\'s arms but it wasn\\'t quite long enough (horizontally placed of course) & ended up leaving a small fat bulge near the elbow that even small lipo job couldn\\'t fix!!! I would be interested to know or read about someone that had their arms done, because I have seen pics on arms before so I thought that was strange...\\n             \\n             Had procedure done at after consultation at 2 pm. They took before pics & had me rotate in a circle while snapping away.. Then led me to coolsculpting room. I undressed & stood in front of a mirror while the nurse marked my legs with a sharpe in a horizontal line. Then she had me lay on a bed propped up in front of a tv, she placed a cool gel pad on my first inner thigh and then placed the machine. I felt light headed because I always freak myself out when it comes to these things... But everything was fine. The initial pull is quite intense and the cold is of corse, shocking. I found it to be rather uncomfortable the whole time but not unbearable. It sort of stung and ached. An hour later I was done. The worst part is the massage afterwards. My leg was red and raw and she was massaging all around-I actually winced in pain. Don\\'t let anyone tell you this is painless because it hurt like hell.i had to pee halfway through and it felt real funny to walk through the halls in a robe to the restroom but oh well... After that she did other leg for the next hour. She left the room but came back to check on my periodically. I also had a button to press in case of emergencies. I was much more relaxed with second leg because I knew what to expect. Again-the massage was the worst part.\\n             \\n\\n             Afterwards she wiped marker off-wich hurt again... My inner thighs were incredibly sore, but numb? Lol sounds weird but really felt like a \"cold burn...\" I felt heavy and numb for first 5 days. Like abnormally heavy. I don\\'t eeigh myself much for personal reasons but I knew I had to have gained a few pounds because I haven\\'t been able to wear jeans-only maxi skirts/dresses. I was incredibly bloated, uncomfortable, felt like I had two solid water filled tree trunks for legs. Today is the 6th day and I\\'m just now being relieved of the swelling. And it wasn\\'t just in my legs-it was my whole body! Apparently everyone\\'s body reacts differently, but I\\'m glad I didn\\'t schedule any important meetings these past 6 days because I feel/sort of look like a balloon. I\\'m just now getting the \"deep itch\" everyone says try feel. It\\'s almost a relief to me because in my mind anything is better than the massive swelling I had. I mean I\\'m too embarrassed to even share pictures-I know this had to be a rare reaction although some others have probably experienced it as well.\\n             \\n             But as for right now, my inner thighs are extremely itchy, like deep down inside. I\\'m trying to massage them but they are still sore and it doesn\\'t help anyways. I hope this means the procedure is working. I guess we will play the waiting game now... I will post before /after pics when it has been the proper amount of time. I\\'m really hoping this works-they say you are supposed to feels \"stinging\" and \"butning, electrical\" sensation by now but all I feel is intense itching!!! Will post again in a week.',\n",

It made such little difference to me, I wish I would have just went with REAL lipo, or possibly a thigh lift.\\n             \\n\\n             Before the procedure they draw lines on you down your inner thigh with a sharpie, and the placement of the lines is sort of strange-it goes down the inner thigh and sort of wraps around to the back of your leg instead of just going straight down. So if you were to look backwards in a mirror, you would be able to see the lines wrapping outward from the inside of your legs, if that makes sense... Anyways, I kept telling the nurse that I thought she should have grabbed more of the inner thigh fat rather than the fat on the back of my leg area-but she insisted that what I was pointing to was \"skin\" and not fat...That is what made me think I should have had lipo with a thigh lift instead of cool sculpting, because I do have some more loose skin with stretch marks there.\\n             \\n\\n             All in all, both procedures were the same and the second one was definitely more pleasant because I knew what to expect and I wasn\\'t as anxious about anything.

I contacted my CS practitioner right away (who was awesome) and she contacted the CoolSculpt rep. The rep was certain this had nothing to do with CS! I went to the ER, internist, gyno, have had blood, urine, stool, tests, ultrasounds, and x-rays. It is not thyroid or liver or kidney or anything else. They found me in perfect health. Literally the only change I made to my life was CS.\\n             \\n\\n             I am still excited to see the ultimate results (it's nearly 3 weeks) and am not criticizing the procedure—it could be extremely effective. I just want folks to know that this does happen. I have seen posts along these lines and the responses from doctors is that this must be something other than CS. Lots of money, poking and prodding later, it's pretty hard to imagine that CS is not the cause.\",\n",

They were offering 20% off if you signed up that night, and it came in at $960 with the discount. I had the largest one available for my ab (belly bottom area).\\n             \\n\\n              The below is my experience (I had my partner with me, for support, who will also be getting the procedure done next month): The first seven minutes were filled with an uncomfortable feeling.\\n             \\n\\n              I would not say painful, as someone who has a low tolerance for pain. :) It definitely is like a pinching sensation as the area is being sucked up. After about 2 minutes you feel it getting extremely cold. When you get to the 7 minute mark, you pretty much go numb.\\n             \\n\\n              I was talking with my partner, reading a magazine, and watching tv within the hour. I hit the button to call the doctor when the machine was done (there is a timer on it so you can see the countdown for the entire 60 minutes). When removed, the area that was treated was raised up and red. The doctor preceeded to take his hand and flatten out the area. I touched it for only a second as it was obviously extremely cold.\\n             \\n\\n              As I got up, it became more painful to the point where it felt like a defrosting of the skin. Pain was not unbearable, as I had a feeling in my mind that it would encompass some uncomfortableness/pain either at the beginning or end. It was very tender and sore, and I had more difficulty standing up. When I say down it felt better. After about 10 minutes that feeling of slight pain/uncomfortablness went away.\\n             \\n\\n              My partner and I actually went to a shopping outlet afterwards for about 4 hours. I was trying on clothes, bending, reaching, etc., and there was absolutely no pain, and just tenderness to the touch. Slept like a baby that night. It is now Day 2, and there is absolutely no pain and no \"stinging\" that some people have mentioned. It is still slightly tender to the touch, but not uncomfortable. Look forward to sharing results as the weeks go on, and hopefully still no side effects. Pictures to come.... All the best!',\n",

       " {'body': \"I have been back and forth about a few procedures over the last few years. I have breast implants that need replacing and I have belly fat and thigh fat I just can't get rid of. I would also like to get rid of my extra chin. So I purchases 8 treatments, one each for the inside and outside of my thighs (4), one each for the banana roll area under my butt cheeks, and two for my chin because they said it takes that many.\\n             \\n\\n             I went for my chin and inside both thighs on 6/4. My chin wasn't bad, it was cold, then numb but when she took it off, the 10 minutes massage was very uncomfortable because it was thawing out. I had no bruising. A warm cloth also helped get it back to the temp it needed to be.\\n             \\n\\n             The inside of my thighs are another story. The procedure itself was not unbearable, the massage was not even too bad. By time I got home though, my legs were bruised and swollen. I took pictures and she said it was the worst she had ever seen. Black and swollen the next day from my crotch area half way down my thigh. But it was gone in a week.\\n             \\n\\n             I went back on 6/7 to do the area on the back of both thighs, called the banana roll, below my but. No bruising and it didn't hurt at all. I was just a little numb for 4-5 days.\\n             \\n\\n             I have an appointment today for the outside of my thighs.\\n             \\n\\n             I have surgery scheduled 6/28 to have my implants exchanged and lipo of my flanks and abdomen.\\n             \\n\\n             I'll let you know how it goes. As far as progress, I think my double chin is much better, I will do one more treatment mid July. I have not noticed much on my legs yet but I think it is too soon.\\n             \\n\\n             Drink lots of water, you can also massage the area or have someone else do it if it helps.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I mentioned in my first post that I was having my saline implants replaced with silicone. I also scheduled liposuction of my bra fat, flanks, upper and lower abdomen. I had these procedures on 6/28.\\n             \\n\\n             I don't have pictures yet. I went for my 4-6 week check up yesterday of the cool sculpting and the 3 week check up of the lipo and breast augmentation, and of course more pictures and measurements were taken. My doctor says I am right where I should be and everything looks good.\\n             \\n\\n             I have lost 1/2 inch on both thighs which is good but not significant. The technician said my banana roll area looked great...showed the most improvement.\\n             \\n\\n             I have lots of edema from the lipo, and it has been quite painful despite wearing the stage 1 compression garment for 2 full weeks, then intermittently with a stage 2 garment this past week. I still feel lumpy, but Dr said it was normal for me to still feel this way, only 3 weeks post op. The day of my surgery went well. After recovery I got up to go home and had lots of drainage from the lipo suction, almost all drainage was coming from the lowest incision on my abdomen. I had an incision under each arm, one thru my navel and 4 across the lowest part of my abdomen. I was extremely swollen, sore and bruised over the next 2 weeks.\\n             \\n\\n             I went from 375 cc saline implants to 475 high profile silicone implants, a huge improvement in the way they appear, but not much larger. They are higher and fuller.\\n             \\n\\n             The dr said he suctioned 1900 ml or almost 2 liters of fat during the lipo. However, I found out first they put in 4 liters of fluid before they take out the 2 liters of fat. I guess to soften it up and make it easier to suction. Not sure. I also received 2 bags of IV fluids. SO this explains some of the swelling and edema. The trauma from all of the lipo explains the rest of it. My abdomen feels like I have been punched in it about 100 times, it really took a beating. But this is normal too.\\n             \\n\\n             Post three weeks, I feel good, not as swollen but still some swelling and pain. I think it will only get better.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I had cool sculpting on my saddlebags March 7. That treatment was easy, didn't hurt at all, and results started showing 6weeks later. It seems to have helped with the cellulite in the area as well. April 21 I went back and had my inner thigh fat pockets done. That treatment was easy as well!! I had my lower abdomen done on both sides after my inner thighs. They used only one applicator so it took 2 hours for stomach. One hour for each side. Connecting to the machine hurt here!! I have fat pockets here as well but it hurt, burned, and was very uncomfortable. It did get better as the first 10 minutes passed by. I dreaded attaching the other side for the last treatment, almost like a kid getting 2 shots????. I was in the office from 8:30-2:30. I felt fine as I left. Later on in the day my stomach began to swell and hurt. It has been a week and a day and my lower stomach feels like there is a steel ball in there, hurts, swollen, bloated, knotty, and last night burned. I slept with an ice pack. I can not wear any blue jeans or tight fitting jeans. It is the beginning of lake season for us and I look and feel 3 months pregnant. I have not enjoyed this past week at all. They told me it could last for 2 weeks. I am praying it has a wonderful turn out after all this discomfort. My legs have been fine - no problem with them. I had thought about doing my flanks but I am scared to now. I will keep updating my post.\",\n",

I followed the reviews on this site for months and decided that with approximately 70% of fairly positive experiences this would be worth a try.\\n              \\n\\n              The process went exactly as described. Photos were taken of me from multiple angles, and I was taken into a small room w/ a bed and the Zeltiq machine. They applied the cool gel strip, which was not as shockingly cold as I had been warned. Then came the actual suction. I'm not a big guy, and the PA was concerned that I might not have enough fat to use a large applicator, but in the end we definitely found the fat :) The surprising part was how powerful the suction that it completely flattened the flesh into a layer inches away from my body as if it had been rolled out like dough.\\n              \\n\\n              The first ten minutes were as described; uncomfortable but not painful. The extreme pressure takes your breath away, but I was given an IPad on which to watch Netflix, so I focused my attention on that and my breathing returned to normal quickly. There was some discomfort/pain during the procedure, but it wasn't great. A bit of a struck nerve feeling passed through my stomach 3-4 times but it was bearable.\\n              \\n\\n              After the procedure was over, the PA returned to massage the hideous bar-of-butter shape that had amassed. It was solid and definitely looked gross but it re-absorbed fairly quickly. The redness was gone within 20 minutes, and the area remained completely numb for hours, with the occasional streak of nerve pain, or dull itch I couldn't quite scratch. I went straight to the gym and worked out back and biceps for a few hours with no problem whatsoever.\\n              \\n\\n              That was yesterday. As of today, the numbness has mostly gone away and left a general soreness. Nothing at all severe, just a dull ache as if the entire area were bruised. I'm writing this from work and so far it hasn't prevented me from going about my normal activities yet. But, if the testimonies are correct, the soonest I'll start having signs of potential neuropathies would be day 3, so I may be in the initial coasting phase.\",\n",

To the contrary, had I known how painful (not merely \"uncomfortable\" as they told me when I went in for my consult) it would be just to have the procedure done, I would never have done it. I knew almost instantly this was a mistake. Upon reflection, I didn\\'t do my due diligence in researching the procedure either. I was told it\\'d be a few months before I saw results and that I might have some \"mild pain or discomfort\" following the procedure, but that not everyone does. The extent to which some of these other women on here describe their pain, I would have never risked it. Now I\\'m sitting here on day 2 hugely swollen, badly bruised, and waiting for the next phase of the pain to kick in. I am so regretful of this decision and spending all of this money.

They do not use doctors for their procedures and are clearly focused on selling their product. If you are looking for a quick fix on a problem area, yea, cool sculpting isn't it.

       " {'body': \"Hello again. About a month ago, I decided to try CoolSculpting of the abdomen thanks to the positive results posted on this site. I am keeping track of my abdomen area on a different post. I have not noticed much difference, but I am hopeful it will work and I definitely notice a little bit of a difference.\\n             \\n             After 30 days of getting the abdomen area done, I decided to go back and do my love handles. The first picture (two pictures attached to one) is before any cool sculpting and the after is the abdomen area.\\n             \\n             The remainder of the pictures are for my love handles. I did the procedure last Tuesday, Sep 12th and being that I had gone for abdomen area a month before, I knew what to expect.\\n             \\n             My experience is the following:\\n             \\n             I saw Carly (because I just love her) at Beleza Med Spa. Carly is very thorough during prep and tells you exactly what she's doing and why she's doing it. After Carly was done prepping, etc., she put the machine on for 34 minutes. The first 4 minutes are crazy cold and after that, the area goes numb and I felt absolutely nothing. It was not uncomfortable. Carly came in a few minutes before the treatment was done and started prepping for the massage. I must say the massage is my LEAST favorite part of the procedure. It goes not hurt, just uncomfortable. Carly massaged the area for 3-6 minutes and again, no pain just uncomfortable.\\n             \\n             Today is day 6 and I am already feeling those pains and needles everyone talks about on my love handles. I am still NOT feeling any pains/needles in my abdomen area.\\n             \\n             As you can see, I bruised. Please take into account I bruise very easily. I will post another love handle update on day 14.\\n             \\n             Pic 1 (w/two pictures) - Left - before any procedure; Right - 30 days post abdomen procedure. I can see a bit of change...not a lot, but somewhat. This was the same day I did my love handles.\\n             \\n             Pic 2 - Before/After abdomen area\\n             \\n             Pic 3 - Day of procedure on love handles\\n             \\n             Pic 4 - Left side love handle...bruises\\n             \\n             Pic 5 - Right side love handle..more bruising\\n             \\n             Every procedure must be different because I did not bruise, experience any pain or discomfort in the abdomen area.\\n             \\n             I can't wait to start noticing the difference. I am happy I saw Carly, she made me feel comfortable. I do recommend Beleza Med Spa downtown.\\n             \\n             Can you see the coolsculpting working a little bit in picture #2?

I currently eat healthy and exercise 2-3 days a week.

I will also post my before and after pics after 3 months. I really relied on this website to make my decision so I will pay it forward for those looking into this procedure as well.\",\n",

Still no results (not expecting any yet) but still a little swollen I think. I have been drinking lots of water and taking a CLA supplement which I was told by the nurse would help. I actually used to take this supplement when I was super fit so I thought I would get back on it. I was at 125 lbs. when I went in for the procedure and currently at 128 lbs. my goal is to be at 120 lbs. this is my \"happy\" weight. Even if I do get to my happy weight I will know if this procedure worked or not seeing how these trouble spots never went away.',\n",

The nurse did say I would be very sore around my belly button and she wasn't lying. I get very little sleep. I had 2 spots done on my back, i get random discomfort there but nothing like the discomfort in my belly.\\n             \\n\\n             Here's my update, on 5.10.14 I feel like I'll be back to normal soon. I mean, as far as the normal feeling within my stomach.\\n             \\n             The morning I awoke after reading the many threads I called the Dr Office that did my procedure and asked for pain medication. The Tylenol and Benadryl that the nurse said should be all I need had no affect. I was prescribed 20 pills of Hydrocodone. I was a allowed to take 1-2 every 4 to 6 hours The first day I took 2 pills every four hours because that's when the meds wore off and I needed them that bad. Every day after I would take one pill with a motrin or 2 when needed. I stop taking the pain medication when I was down to 2 pill in the container.\\n             \\n             It's now the week after the procedure I do think see any results yet but I am faithful I will have an amazing results. Plus the Dr said with all the discomfort I am having that's normally a good sign, for my size and exactly what I had done. We shall see.\",\n",

They place the gel sheet on the area, place a suction device on top of the pad and turn it on. Within a few seconds, the area is sucked up into the device (they call a tip). They used the largest tip and did the area from my belly button down and from hip bone to hip bone. It sucks pretty hard and gets really cold. After about five mins the area gets numb and you cant really feel anything. They leave the tip in place cooling for an hour. I had my upper abs done right after - they used the small tip this time. Another hour later i was ready to go. No real pain, the area is totally numb/frozen. Like when you leave an ice pack on for a while.\\n             \\n\\n             Later that night i started feeling like i had done 1000 crunches. The next day was about the same but the numbness was gone and replaced with a different feeling. You know the feeling you get when your foot falls asleep? That stingy tingly pain. Thats what my stomach felt like for about two weeks. Really bad the first week where, i guarded myself anytime anyone got near me. Of course with time it got better.\\n             \\n\\n             Results? They told me it could take up to three months for the dead fat cells to totally absorb. I paid for five treatments.

I am so glad i did - the office i went to had the new coolsculpting tips and the treatment only took 35 mins per area (no longer an hour) and the sunction was not even detectable to me... Only the cooling sensation. Now once they took off the tips, that massage felt really aweful and I got lightheaded & clammy (best to not sit up - lay flat after for a minute or in the fetal position on your side for 5 mins). Those 5 mins were just aweful. However, i then through on my spanx and went to the gym. Day 2 and no bruising or anything. The area isnt swollen - looks the same as pre-treatment. Now to wait. 2-4 months! Im shocked- other reviews talked about how aweful the suction was, the pain of the cold - and I literally had none of that. No downtime, as advertised. The doc did say going to the gym the first 2 days really helps avoid pain - I dont know but I went and I have no discomfort, no swelling, no bruising, no pink areas. Ill go back in 1 month for the 2nd session but so far - so glad i did it with zero pain (other than those 5 mins of post treatment awefulness).\\n             \\n\\n             My cost was $600 per area',\n",

       " {'body': 'This is a relatively new treatment in Adelaide. I am 49 years 5\\' 9\" and weigh 65.5 kilos. I have always been relatively thin but recently noticed a tummy pooch that did not improve no matter how many tummy cruches I did. A well known clinic in Adelaide got this machine 12 months ago so I decided to give it a try. They charge pretty hefty at $1000 per site. The doctor advised that I would need 2 x 1 hour sessions on my tummy (2hrs all up). Interestingly she also advised that they would use the small unit side ways on my tummy, this she said was due to the way my tummy bulge was positioned, she said you could grab more sideways than straight across.She said she had it done on her upper abdomen and it was now completely flat, she also said she started to notice results beginning at 1 month with best result at 4months. I asked her about pain, and she said there would be none, no side effects!!!\\n              \\n\\n              Anyway, on the day they weighed, measured and took pictures. Then applied the very cold gel pad and sucked me up in that machine. It shocked me at first, then went numb, I noticed that during the last 5 minutes or so there were like little bursts of twinges, this happened on both sides. When they removed the machine I had the stick of butter as others had described (only mine ran sideways down my abdomen), she gently massaged this down. I was very red and had bruising in 2 areas like a mirror image of each other on both sides of my belly button. I was very numb but no real pain, I was wearing jeans and this did not bother me. She did not tell me to do any massage and gave no after care instructions, just made an appointment to see me in 3 months.\\n              \\n\\n              The next day I was very sore and numb. But bearable. During the next few days the pain increased, it kind of felt like a burning abrasion and sometimes it would tingle with knife like pains. I am not one to take pain killers so just put up with it. I had trouble sitting in certain positions and sometimes the pain would just grab me. About day 6 I had a bad night sleeping but since then it has gradually improved.\\n              \\n\\n              I noticed my tummy appeared to be swollen and my weight has jumped up by about 1 kilo. I am now at day 13 and still a fair bit numb and now only occasionally do I notice little needle like stinging, but the abrasion feeling is still there. Now comes the wait to see the results hopefully. I do feel that the clinic neglected to truly explain the after effects, I don\\'t believe I\\'d be the only one to experience this sort of pain. Thankfully I have a strong tolerance to pain and soldier on as I don\\'t have time to deal with it as I own a demanding restaurant and need to be on my feet for long hours! Will let you know if I notice anything soon .......',\n",

       " {'body': \"Ironically, I did my research and bought I knew all there was to know about cool sculpting. I was told I would get good results. I have to wait 12 weeks to see them and its only been a week, but this past week has been agony.\\n             \\n\\n             Like most the comments on PAIN AND COOL SCULPTING, I only searched for the pain comments AFTER having cool sculpting done. I had 3 applicators done on my stomach a week ago. I had some bruising which I wasn't surprised about as the suction is pretty intense, the massage was after uncomfortable but bearable, but the stabbing pains and burning I have felt for the past 5 days has been excruciating and I have a high pain tolerance.\\n             \\n\\n             I opted for cool sculpting because after two c-sections, 6 years ago I had a mini tummy tuck and some liposuction done to get rid of the double smily face on my belly. It was a good operation and pain eased a little more each day post surgery. The bruising and swelling immediately post surgery was pretty impressive and the small holes where they put the tubes were interesting. No hiding what you had done and wearing a compression garment was uncomfortable, especially as I live in the tropics. But overall I got a good result and I feel it was worth doing.\\n             \\n\\n             However whilst my lower tummy was flat, I was left with a hump around my midriff that has annoyed me for years. I thought cool sculpting would be an easier and less invasive way to get rid of the hump. I did lots of research and consulted three different salons before committing to cool sculpting. Even spoke to some people who had the procedure done and they said it was uncomfortable but after a few days all was fine.\\n             \\n\\n             If I had known how much pain I would be in and how squidgy like my areas now feel from it, like disintergated jello like the characters out of x-men that were mutated by Magneto, I would have just done the lipsocution again, because after 7 days, I would have been well onto my way to recovery instead of suffering this stabbing spasmodic irregular pain, and not knowing when or If it will stop. And waiting 12 weeks to see if get a result acceptable to me.\\n             \\n\\n             Seriously folks, think twice before doing this procedure, I would never do it again. Although the liposuction looks so aggressive and bruising can be bad and pain is bad for the first few days, results I think are more guaranteed and you know that with normal healing the pain eases every day. And pain killers work for the liposuction pain, not much is working for me with this stabbing pain from the cool sculpting. Cool sculpting side effects of stabbing pain, burning, deep tissue itching, bruising, cramps, and nerve ending damage are far more common than any consultant led me to believe.\\n             \\n\\n             I know its irrational, but I wonder what else got frozen during the process and whether my intestines are damaged. I ache inside and out and after two c-sections, a broken legs in 2 places, a mini tummy tuck and liposuction, this pain, is one of the worst as it is intense, and random and worst 7 days post procedure than it was not he day I had it done.\\n             \\n\\n             Horrible procedure, and like a few others, I wish i just worked a bit harder in the gym to get rid of my hump round the middle instead of wasting my money on this.\",\n",

It felt like an intense pulling and pinching. I felt as though i was counting down those 6 mins when the numbness would kick in. After about ten minutes i was able to watch T.V. and play with my phone and i wasn't in any pain. I didn't feel any coolness during that time i still felt a faint pulling and numbness in my belly area.\\n             \\n             When it was time for the applicator to come off. That was fine. However, when it was time for the nurse to start massaging my block of meat.. it was quiet uncomfortable. I was curling my toes and waiting for it to be over.\\n             \\n             Standing up felt nauseating but wasn't too bad. My tummy felt bloated and foreign. I was able to go home by public transport. There is no bruising whats so ever. Just numbness and every time i touch my belly it stings a little. A bit uncomfortable. I was a bit constipated that night so bowel movement and pushing wasn't comfortable with the stomach being sore and all.\\n             \\n             Day 2-\\n             \\n             Last night sleep was okay. I had to sleep on my back. It feels like I've just done a massive hike the day before. Stomach stings when i do touch it. So far its okay. I find it odd that they say there is no down time to this treatment.. the soreness isn't so bad but its the kind of soreness where would want to just lay or sit in bed all day and not do anything. I wouldn't want to go to work feeling like this and cant imagine exercising. I think it would be unbearable if i were to exercise considering that it is still sore whenever i jump or jiggle my belly a bit. No need for Nurofen plus or Panadol as of yet.\",\n",

Dispute my healthy lifestyle I was struggling to loose that stubborn lower belly.buldge. I decided to try cool sculpting on my lower abdomen and inner thighs. I just had the cool sculpting procedure done in CT. I had the large adaptor on my lower abdomen. I thought when they first sucked my abdomen into the machine it felt like it took my breathe away. Just from the tightness and pulling from the machine. That sensation only lasted a few minutes. I didn\\'t feel any discomfort from the cold but I did feel cramping. The producer lasted an hour. I have to say I felt cramps the entire time but, it was manageable. I took a Xanax before the procedure and I would recommend taking something if possible. When they removed the device my tummy looked like a red frozen stick of butter. They rubbed my belly until it returned to normal. That was very uncomfortable and made the cramps more intense. Then once they finished I had no more discomfort. I felt completely fine with only numbness and minor swelling. I am one day out from the procedure and no pain just a strange numb sensation in the entire area that was treated. I have an apt next week to treat my inner thighs and my right outer hip. I will post some before pictures and updates on my progress.',\n",

       " {'body': \"After reading many online reviews about different non-invasive fat reduction procedures, I decided to give Cool Sculpting a try considering it's safe and the overall grading provided noticable results.\\n             \\n             There are not many places offer this treatment in CT, so I went to the medi-spa in northern CT. What I like about this spa is the owner talked to me over the phone and we exchanged emails before I went in to get a consulation, he asked for my weight and height, then told me according to my BMI, I did not need a Smart Lipo which they also offer, he suggested Cool Sculpting should work on me, so I decided to give it a try. The first treatment was $1500 for just one big applicator on my lower abdomen, which is a little expensive.\\n             \\n             The treatment itself did not bother me much for the first time, but after the treatment, around day 10 and day 11, I felt pretty uncomfortable, my stomach upset me that I needed to call the spa to ask for advice. The owner told me he did not recommend to take stronger medicine, just over-the-counter pain reliever should work, therefore I never had any prescription drugs during that 2-week after the procedure. Luckily, once I passed the two weeks mark, my discomfort were gone, then I just checking myself and take photos to see if there's any change on me. After week 3, my husband admitted that my belly did look smaller, my husband has critical eyes, so what he said should really count.\\n             \\n             Once I reached week 13, I considered I have seen enough result from the 1st treatment, so I scheduled a second treatment with the same spa to target the upper abdomen that was not treated at the first time. The certified technician took the after pictures of me to compare to what she took for before treatment, she did see a big difference, she put before and after phonto side-by-side for me to look too, yes, the round belly has been reduced by a lot.\\n             \\n             When I was ready to get the second treatment, Natalie used different measurements to see if using 2 smaller applicators on each side would be better or to use just one large applicator on the upper abdomen, so she chose to use one large applicator only,, This time she really pull my fat hard, tried to grab as much fat as she could to squeeze.into the applicator, this time I felt more uncomfortable during the treatment because my skin were pulled too tight, my body felt very tense.\\n             \\n             After the treatment, I did not suffer as much bruising, swollen, itching and pain like the first time, Although she pull me very tight, perhaps my body did not have enough treatable fat left to be target, so I see can still little more fat reduction, but definitely not such an obvious result like the first time. Since this is the same procedure for the same problematic area, I got a discount of 50%, which was $750.\\n             \\n             I do feel I don't carry that much fat anymore, my belly is not that bulging like it used to be, this kind of feeling is good. In the meantime, I still have to watch what I eat and do light exercise so the weight won;t gain back.\\n             \\n             I will recommend this treatment to persons who have moderate localized fat, if the fat becomes too large in area and goes too deep, then an more invasive method may get better result..\",\n",

My stomach was disproportionate to the rest of my slim figure. It runs in the family. I had a total of 2 treatments--1 on my lower abdomen (the original plan) and 1 on my upper stomach afterwards. At first, I did not plan on doing my upper stomach. But, after my lower stomach was fully healed and slimmed down, my upper stomach appeared to pop out. They said this can commonly happen if you don\\'t do both areas, so if you\\'re going for the stomach area, I recommend doing both upper and lower, even if you don\\'t think you need to at first. It\\'s been a year and overall, I am very happy with the final result. I still have a few area that I can see as uneven. No one else can, but I would be lying if I said it didn\\'t bother me a bit.

       " {'body': 'I had Coolsculpting done on my love handles on Aug 14th 2011 . I’m a fit person and eat healthy (128 lbs, 5’6) but still had some bulging on my sides and my lower abs that were just impossible to get rid of with diet and exercise. I heard about this procedure about six months ago but was a little skeptical. Did it really work? No pain or down time? After reading reviews, going in for a free consultation and seeing the before and after pictures at the office I decided to try it. My consultation went great! They weren’t pushy and were very detailed and honest about the procedure and the results.\\n              \\n\\n              The procedure itself had some mild discomfort but nothing I couldn’t handle. They used the small applicator on my love handles. The initial feeling of the suction is somewhat uncomfortable, kind of takes your breath away but this only last about 1-3 minutes, not bad. After, about 3-5 minutes it goes numb and there is no discomfort. I read a book and had my morning coffee during the process. The clinician was great and made me feel so comfortable. When they take the machine off the area is freezing, it looks like your skin is a stick of butter. (It will look a lot worse than it is!) They begin to massage the area down. Again for me this was a little uncomfortable, not painful it just feels odd. By the time I left the office the area a little swollen and tender but no pain. I went right back to my daily exercise and routine. For the next 10 days the area was numb and sore. It also felt like needles prickling in that area. After two weeks it went back to normal, I get occasional itching on the area.\\n              \\n\\n              In two weeks I noticed about a 15% reduction!!! YES UNBELIVABLE!!! My clothes fit better around the waist and I have had people notice! I haven’t lost weight but inches. They will tell you that you should wait two months for the final results and it has only been 4 weeks and I am so happy with my results. I went back two weeks ago to get my lower abs done. Same results as my love handles this far. I would recommend this procedure to everyone that cannot get rid of those stubborn pockets of fat. Well worth the money spent.($2,800 for both love handles and lower abs) Now I know I have an option that doesn’t hurt and doesn’t take a long time to recover! I hope this review helps since I found everyone else’s reviews so helpful before deciding on going through with it.\\n              \\n\\n              I will update and post before and after pictures after three months. I’m so excited and looking forward to the final results!!! The staff at the office was GREAT!',\n",

I believed it came as a result of a lot of hard work but after turning 40 and waking up one morning (it felt like it happened overnight!) with many extra inches around my waist, I decided to give CoolSculpting a try. It works! I had my first treatment on 1/31 and at my 3 month follow up I had lost over 9 cm (that's how they measure it) . . . that's 4 inches! My technician told me that if I wanted the WOW effect, that I should do another treatment on the area so on 4/30 I had my second treatment.\\n             \\n\\n             For those of you considering CoolSculpting I would highly recommend it! I'm not going to lie, it is a little painful when the machine literally sucks your fat into a small cup but the pain goes away within a few minutes. My skin is fair so I did have minimal bruising and swelling during the first 7 days.

Went back for a second cool core to my stomach area, (Around 9 weeks after the first) very happy so far.',\n",

       " {'body': 'Earlier this month I had my consultation for Coolsculpting, something that just recently came to my town. The medical lady at the day spa used a measuring tool (it is like a stencil, shaped like the applicators) to recommend the applicator and approach based on my goal and needs.\\n             \\n\\n             I have had two children, both pregnancies I gained about 40 pounds. I am in good shape, I workout 5-6 days a week, so it is very frustrating I have stubborn pockets of fat, especially in my belly. I told her I wanted to address my belly, and eventually my flanks too. She ended up recommending two small applicators to go from approximately my belly button to my hip on either side.\\n             \\n\\n             I decided to call Friday and schedule my appointment, it turns out they had an opening THAT night so I spoke with my husband and decided to go for it!\\n             \\n\\n             When I went into the room, I changed into a very unflattering pair of shorts to protect underwear and/or give privacy. The technician (different from the medical staff that did the consultation) pulled out the applicators and double checked what large would cover and what two small would cover. She did not do any markers, she had me go ahead and sit down in an upright position, then applied the gel sheet to the right side of my stomach. She asked if I was ready, I took a calm exhale and she applied the applicator. There was an immediate pull like when I squeezed my stomach tight (to see how much fat I\\'ve got there), it didn\\'t hurt at all, and once it was applied I realized how tense my back was, so I relaxed. The cooling started after a few minutes. It started to feel really cool on my hip at 6 minutes to my belly button. The nurse checked in on me a few times during that hour, but for the most part I just sat leaning back slightly, watching a TV show on my iPad.\\n             \\n\\n             Around 5 minutes I felt what I thought was suction slowly decreasing, but the tech said it was actually the \"massage\". It just felt like little pulses on the frozen area. Time really flew! It was time to take it off, she just carefully pressed her fingers under the applicator to break the suction. I took pictures of my \"butter block\" but it really didn\\'t look as big as the ones you see from the large applicator. It definitely felt frozen and numb, and was strange to touch. She applied a warm wet cloth twice, and rubbed the area. I went to the restroom as she prepared for my second application.\\n             \\n\\n             The other side started and felt the same, although my right side seemed to be hang loosely compared to the left during the right side\\'s application (you can see it in the picture).\\n             \\n\\n             I had to stop myself from wanting to touch it, because I started to worry myself that I\\'d break the suction of the left side! It actually started to bother me, so I called the tech and she came in immediately, and said it was all fine. That answer wasn\\'t good enough for my mind :P So I positioned myself so I felt like it was secure (I\\'m suuuuuure it was!).\\n             \\n\\n             I was feeling much more cold at this point. I had a sweater on, this time, but wearing the shorts (and I came in wearing shorts) didn\\'t help. She had a small towel to cover my feet and offered a larger one but I declined, so by the end of it I was cold!\\n             \\n\\n             The second hour went by just as quickly, and the same thing: the block lost it\\'s form pretty quickly, she applied heated wet cloths and massaged it. She cleaned up as much of the gel as she could and left me to change.\\n             \\n\\n             It felt numb and cold, but no pain... I paid, met my husband and home and then left for a late dinner! I\\'m really looking forward to seeing the progress, but I know it won\\'t be overnight, so I\\'ll keep this review updated with how I feel and any noticeable changes.\\n             \\n\\n             I do want to say that this website was incredibly helpful. I first stumbled across a CoolSculpting review on this site from my Google search on a noninvasive way to deal with the tummy, and I was intrigued. I had been trying to figure out the logistics of visiting a facility out of town, and then a local spa popped up with it!\\n             \\n\\n             I also want to say I\\'m very thankful for all the people that have posted their reviews, replied to their reviews and also the doctors that so actively respond to the Q&A.\\n             \\n\\n             Looking forward to my results!',\n",

They told me the produce did what is was suppose to do, and that another treatment would not deliver results. I was very upset, and they told me to accept it and be happy. When I look at other peoples pictures and see drastic results, I don't understand why it did not work for me. I reduced my body measurements, in the 3 month time period. I was 17.8 % body fat down to 13.0 %, and muscle mass was 39.4 % to 41.5 %. They told me to wait another 2 months, and see if it improves.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'I am a white, 43 year old mom of three from Baltimore Maryland. When I visited Dr. Dean Kane’s office for my Cool-sculpting consultation I felt like a broken woman. I was unhappy with how my stomach looked and no matter what I did (exercise, dieting) I just couldn’t get rid of that last bit of stomach flab after the birth of my youngest. My pants did not fit comfortably and I was so tired of not being able to wear what I wanted. It was very depressing and I couldn’t figure out what to do and I was tired of living with it. I knew that surgery wasn’t for me, so when I heard about Cool-sculpting I thought, maybe now I can get rid of this flab! Well-that’s exactly what happened. Dr. Kane thought I was a perfect candidate for this procedure, as it would freeze away the stubborn fat that was there for years. A technician named Joy was slated to perform my procedure, which was quickly scheduled within two weeks. I had it done on two areas of my abdomen, left and right side of my belly button, with the regular size applicator. Both machines were on my abdomen at the same time and the procedure lasted about 2 hours. Initially when the applicators were positioned they “vacuumed” in the fat. It felt cold, like an ice pack was on my stomach, but then that feeling dissipated and it really was un-noticeable. During the procedure, the machines essentially “sucked up” the fat and froze those cells. I was completely comfortable the whole time and chatted with my friend and read magazines. When the procedure was finished and the machines came off, Joy manipulated the “frozen fat cells”. She described it as feeling like squishing a frozen bag of peas. For me, this was the only part that was a bit uncomfortable. Not really painful, just a weird feeling. Joy said that I would start to notice results within about 4weeks and that my body would naturally eliminate those dead fat cells. I left the office excited and resumed normal activities the next day. The fact that there was essentially no down-time was a big plus for me. I had slight bruising in the area, and it was tender to the touch, but no other issues. After a few weeks I could see the results and it was awesome! I would highly recommend wearing a “spanx-like” girdle, post-procedure. It helped keep everything contained around the treated area. I am absolutely thrilled at my results from Cool-sculpting! My abdomen has shrunk significantly and there is no more muffin-top. Even my waistline has appeared again. I feel comfortable in my clothes and enjoyed buying myself a new bikini to wear at the pool. Cool-sculpting really jump-started the transformation back to my old self. I highly recommend it!',\n",

       " {'body': 'I\\'m only three days post-procedure and the pain is nearly debilitating. There\\'s nothing quite like nerve pain. There\\'s nothing quite like this procedure.\\n             \\n             The only word I can really come up with is \"barbaric.\" I don\\'t think I\\'d do it if I had it to do over again. It feels like a punishment for just not going to the gym.\\n             \\n             I had a breast augmentation five weeks ago and recovery didn\\'t hurt this badly.\\n             \\n\\n             The procedure itself made me legitimately question what I was doing with my life and my body and how I could have possibly fallen this far from grace. The suction, the numbness, taking the device off and the massage afterward - it all felt so barbaric and experimental. The suction pain was dizzying. The cooling process was a walk in the park. The removal of the device and subsequent massage made me see stars. I saw stars from the pain and had to dig deep into my very soul for the strength not to cry and beg for time to be rewound.\\n             \\n\\n             I am three days post-procedure and now it is everything in me not to cry from the CONSTANT electrical, prickling, surprising pain. It wakes you up in the night. It makes you double over out of nowhere from a shocking, sudden stabbing feeling. The pain is like a group of electrical angry hornets are following you around all day and randomly decide to sting you all at once at varying times and degrees.\\n             \\n             It is the kind of pain that makes you wonder if it will ever end and makes you wonder if you should start making plans for managing it for the rest of your life.\\n             \\n\\n             What makes this pain a special kind of awful is that it is just shy of debilitating. It dances on the threshold just enough to make you believe you can get through it between the moments of stabbing electricity ripping through your abdomen and effecting your very emotions.\\n             \\n             The pain is such that you become lethargic from constantly physically and emotionally managing it from one bout of horror to the next.\\n             \\n             I cannot fathom, for the life of me, why nobody warned me of what life was to be like in the weeks to follow the procedure.\\n             \\n             I was sold when I saw before and after photos and hearing a woman tell me that she had the procedure done and was back to work an hour afterward. What that woman failed to tell me was that it would be like a punishment from Satan\\'s second cousin who was practicing unusual punishments for sinners who decided to get coolsculpting instead of just toiling away at the gym like everyone else.\\n             \\n             I want to apologize to my past self for all the times I talked myself out of going to the gym. I want to tell my mom she was right about everything and that I shouldn\\'t have dated that one guy and I should have learned how to sew and I should have eaten better and exercised more.\\n             \\n             I wish I spent the money on a personal trainer. I wish I spent it on veggies and water. I wish I spent it on a juicer or one of those chopper things.\\n             \\n             As I write this, the angry hornets have been attacking my abdomen like I\\'ve kidnapped their queen and I have to choke down sobs of regret.\\n             \\n\\n             Whether or not I come out the other end of this with an amazing tummy, I\\'m never doing this again.\\n             \\n             And if I don\\'t come out the other end of this with an amazing tummy, I\\'m going to tell myself that\\'s what i get for being lazy and eating poorly. I\\'m going to tell myself that\\'s what I get and then carry my tummy pouch over to the hecking gym and exercise like I always should have.\\n             \\n             If anything comes of this at all, it\\'s that I\\'ve learned my lesson. I want no one else doing anything to my body unless it involves my husband making it feel good.\\n             \\n             Now I\\'m off to look for a hecking personal trainer so I can do what I should have done instead of coolsculpting.',\n",

       " {'body': 'Ok. Last you heard from me, I was suffering in the 12th circle of hell with nerve pain 3 days after my coolsculpting. I\\'m happy to report that the pain is gone - it had begun to subside about 4 days after I posted the review and was completely gone about 3 days after that. I had some leftover Vicodin from my BA five weeks prior and I ended up taking one every night for the 4 nights of the worst of the pain. It helped with about 25% of the pain and I was grateful for that 25%.\\n             \\n\\n             Now that I can think straight, I\\'ll give a short review of the facility and then get into the update.\\n             \\n\\n             First and foremost, the only complaints I have has to do with my own body\\'s reaction to the procedure and a little about the procedure itself - not at all with where I went or my practitioner. I went to Belcara in Baltimore, MD and it was everything I could have hoped for in a facility. The staff, nurses, doctors and facility were all grade-A. I will recommend them to anyone I know and sing their praises as any opportunity I get.\\n             \\n\\n             I\\'ve reread my review and honestly, I still stand by everything I said. Even though I am no longer in pain, it is unforgettable to me. It could be because I\\'ve never experienced nerve pain before and that, apparently, I fall into that 10-20% of people who have this late onset pain after coolsculpting. Who knows?\\n             \\n\\n             It\\'s challenging to show the true results in these quick phone pictures, but they\\'re there. Everything fits differently, my midsection feels tighter and I\\'m looking forward to these next several weeks of seeing final results. I went into the procedure with the understanding that coolsculpting will only remove about 25% of the fat from the area. I want to say that it did more than that. I won\\'t say it\\'s been dramatic but if I had to give a number, I\\'d say it was closer to 35-40%.\\n             \\n             I did not change my diet or activities at all. I did exactly as my practitioner said and went about my business as usual and waited for results.\\n             \\n\\n             I guess after the review I wrote, the main question would be, \"was it worth it?\" I can say that I don\\'t feel like I wasted my money. I see better results than I expected and there are another several weeks yet before I see final results. So as far as getting what I paid for is concerned, yes. I got what I paid for.\\n             \\n             There is a caveat to this, however - and that is the pain. As made evident by my review, the pain was such that it brought dang-near poetry out of me. I mean, it was such that I made mention of Satan\\'s second cousin exploring unusual punishment techniques.\\n             \\n             To put it in perspective, I slept with my entire body covered except for my abdomen. One night, I\\'d slept as usual with nothing touching my abdomen but kept waking up from sudden, stinging pain that reverberated throughout my midsection. I finally got up and went to the bathroom to just feel sorry for myself. It was then that I saw exactly one dog fur on my stomach. One 2-inch dog fur touching my stomach caused me relentless pain. This was my life for about 6 days. Respite could be found in the bindings of post-surgical wraps intended for people recovering from tummy tucks. If a shirt rubbed the area, I had to talk myself out of crying.\\n             \\n\\n             When the pain began to subside, it was like I was living in a whole new world. I was Jasmine on that carpet singing with Aladdin. The sun was brighter. Food tasted better. I had forgiven all my enemies and vowed volunteer time to a cat rescue. There wasn\\'t enough I could do to show the universe my gratitude.\\n             \\n             There is only one tiny thing beyond that. I write this 2 months post-procedure and it was only last week that the numbness completely went away. How-hecking-ever, the residual numbness was welcomed with open, enthusiastic arms as long as it wasn\\'t the pain.\\n             \\n\\n             So I guess what I can offer to anyone thinking about getting the procedure done is this. The money part. I personally feel was worth it. I got a little more than the results I expected. That was the easy part.\\n             \\n             The thing you will be gambling with is 1: whether or not you\\'ll fall into the 10-20% of people who experience what I and many other people experienced with the pain and 2: if so, will it be worth it to you for this procedure.\\n             \\n\\n             If it was only the money, I\\'d do it again. But because of what I went through afterward, I will not. I can\\'t even say that I\\'d advise anyone against the procedure. The results are there. You just might... you know, end up wishing you were in a coma for the better part of two weeks or feel like you\\'re being punished, all at once, for six days straight for everything bad you\\'ve ever done in your life and all your lives before it.',\n",

       " {'body': \"I had the procedure done on my lower abdomen and right flanks on 6/6/13 and left flanks on the next day - 1 hr on the belly with the big applicator and 2 hrs - 2 areas on each flank side with the smaller one. I am 37 yo and relatively fit, but couldn't get rid of that fatty pouch on my belly after the pregnancy. The procedure itself was not painful at all. It was a bit unusual when done on the lower abdomen, because i had to make my breathing shallower but that's it. I would describe it as a bit uncomfortable due to the position i had to lay in esp when done on the flanks, but that's about it. The staff, where i did the procedure was very accommodating and made everything possible to make me feel comfortable. Treated me lunch, coffee, dessert-you name it. I watched movies the whole time while there on the office ipad so that definitely helped passing by the hours spent in the office.\\n             \\n             After the procedure i was swollen and sore. The massage right after the procedure was a bit troublesome but for a short time. I was sore and the area sensible to touch for about 3-4 days, had some itching as well.\\n             \\n\\n             days 5, 6 and 7\\n             \\n             This is when the pain was at its peak (only on lower abdomen though, my flanks were fine). On a scale of 1-10 i would say the pain was 9 for me. Like many of you described i had shooting, stabbing, cramping pains, which thankfully were relieved with Advil. However i was plenty uncomfortable to the point i had trouble walking and sleeping.\\n             \\n             So my advise to you is - be prepared. Some people never had anything more than a mild discomfort. However others-like myself, had about a week of down time. Don't expect that you will do just fine with some minimal swelling and soreness and if you happen to have the pain and down time you may be disappointed and angry. If you expect it to happen and it doesn't, all the better! It's definitely a possibility, and the doctor doesn't know why or if it will, so he/she won't be able to tell you.\\n             \\n\\n             Day 8 to 14\\n             \\n             After a week the pain and discomfort started to quickly disappear. I went back to my exercise routine. Now i am 2 weeks post procedure and i still have my lower abdomen numb and a little itchy but totally tolerable. There is no swelling on my flanks, but i think i still notice some on my lower abdomen.\\n             \\n\\n             I know that the results with this procedure take time, so i am just very hopeful and will keep my progress on the site updated. :)\",\n",

This is when they start massaging the area. It hurt me a lot and I have had a lot of painful procedures done.

The procedure itself did not bother me at all, a little uncomfortable for the first 5 minutes but after that it just felt like pressure. I even fell asleep at one point during the procedure. I had 2 areas done, lower abdomen with the large applicator and upper abdomen with the small applicator. I did not get any bruising or swelling after the procedure. I have been taking Bromaline before and after the procedure, which is suppose to help with all that and I think it certainly did. I may be a little bloated but I think I\\'m always bloated so I won\\'t list that as a side effect.\\n             \\n             The day after the procedure I was very sore (kind of like after a really hard workout) I\\'m glad I decided to take that day off of work. The day after (day 3) was terrible, not only was I in horrendous pain but I started getting low back spasms. Luckily the day after that the back spasms subsided. But what really bothers me is this chronic cramping feels like pins and needles and its impossible to sleep at night. Day 4, I started to doing some online research and read about the Neurontin, so I had my Dr call that in for me. Honestly all it does it take the \"edge\" off and make you extremely drowsy. IB Profin doesn\\'t seem to work either. Too be honest the only time the pain ever goes away or subsides is when I have a drink. Not that I\\'m saying hey everyone start drinking booze to feel better but it does work. Haha. Ive also tried wearing really tight pants (like biker shorts) under my clothing and that helps a little. Well here I am day 7 didn\\'t sleep at all last night because of the pain, wondering if this will ever go away and if all this is going to be worth it. I guess only time will tell. I have all my before and during photos, I\\'ll gladly post them once I have the end result. After all this I better get results. If this doesn\\'t work I can honestly say I WOULD NEVER recommend this to anyone. Wish me luck and if anyone has any other tips and advice on how long I will be in pain for please post a comment!

Luckily for me I was offered to be a test patient for the new Vanquish Treatment that just hit the market. Wow, all I can say it this was MUCH Better. Vanquish is completely pain free, comfortable, NO side effects and works much faster. I went in for 4, 30 minute treatments and I lost 1 and 1/2 inches around my waist. This procedure uses heat to melt the fat cells away opposed to freezing it away with the horrendous CoolSculpting Procedure. I'm sure CoolSculpting has worked for some people, but it did not work for me. I really liked the Vanquish treatment and actually saw results with it. And who doesn't want to do something that is pain free?? I would highly recommend doing this procedure over CoolSculpting. I got this procedure done for free because of my dissatisfaction with the CoolSculpting treatment and seeing NO results. I was told the treatment costs around $2000 for 4 to 6 treatments, Vanquish also covers a larger target area then CoolSculpting and is completely pain free. I highly recommend anyone in the market looking in to CoolSculpting to do the Vanquish Treatment instead. Trust me, you will thank me later.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I had Coolsculpting done on my arms on July 14, 2016. The technician at The Waldorf Center didn't place the protective gel pad properly on my left arm. At 40 minutes into the procedure, the pad had sucked into the cup and my skin outside the cup began to feel like it was burning. They shut the machine off to fix the pad, but then it wouldn't turn back on. So, I had only 40 minutes done on my left arm and the full 60 on my right. She didn't apologize or even seem to care that because of her ineptitude I will likely end up with uneven arms. All she had to say was that they could redo the left arm for free if there's any asymmetry. Free? I had already paid for it and it's hardly my fault she didn't know what she was doing. Then when she took my right arm out of the cup, she barely wiped off the gel and told me to get up so she could walk me out. I know it was probably running into her lunch hour, but it was very painful and she wouldn't even give me two minutes to catch my breath before I had to go pay. She did not give me the massage that gives optimal results. I don't know if it's because she was in a hurry or if she was as ignorant about the massage as she seemed to be about placement. But it's probably a good thing I didn't get the massage so my arms might end up being closer to the same size. I don't know her name, she bother to introduce herself. But I cannot recommend this office that would let anyone this inept perform procedures. She had trouble setting up the machines, she screwed up placement of the pad, she had no knowledge of late onset pain and rudely informed me I would have no pain when I tried to ask questions, and really made me feel like I was bothering her just being there. There's too many other places around that perform this service to waste your money here for what I'm sure will be shabby results. The worst part is having to wait 8 or more weeks to see how bad it is. And then possibly having liposuction to fix it.\\n             \\n\\n             So as to the procedure itself.....I had read other people say they went numb after 10 minutes. I did not and it was mildly painful and uncomfortable the entire time. After the cup came off my right arm, it felt like pain just poured into my arm. Once I was outside, my boyfriend massaged it and the pain went away in about 5 minutes. I've had mild pain since then, especially at night trying to sleep. But nothing worth even taking aspirin for. Today, my right hand and arm hurts so I really hope I'm not getting that late onset pain. I'm hoping I slept on it wrong.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'I\\'m 5\\'2\" and swing in the low-to-mid 120s. I hit the gym 6 times a week for a combo of spinning and serious toning workouts and eat a very good diet (with treats on weekends). Nothing has taken away my muffin top. I\\'ve had it all my life and hate it beyond words. Even when I was a skinny-minny teenager I had this pooch. I was thrilled to learn about CoolSculpting b/c there was no way I\\'d go under the knife.\\n              \\n\\n              I had the treatment yesterday at Vibe Salon in Bedford, NS, Canada. I was really worried about the pain, based on descriptions of other reviewers. It\\'s not that bad folks. After a while I felt like I was wearing a pair of too-small jeans: uncomfortable, but not unbearable. However, the massage afterwards is truly awful. It only lasts 2 minutes, but it\\'s a bad 2 minutes. When they took the applicator off me, my stomach was frozen in the shape of the applicator -- all sticking up in the air like a fleshy popsicle. Ugly! They then have to massage out that lump and break up all the frozen bits in your tummy. The woman doing it told me it hurts her fingers, too, so we were in a solidarity of discomfort. It\\'s just a really strange, foreign feeling. I had one fleeting moment of nausea, but that was it.\\n              \\n\\n              I did the lower abdomen first, then the upper. I fell asleep during the upper treatment, and even the upper massage wasn\\'t as bad. I guess the ribs help.\\n              \\n\\n              I had no serious bruising -- I was just a little red. I was, and still am, very swollen. And the flesh feels solid, not pliable like before. It hurts to bend over and I\\'m very tender, but again, it\\'s not unbearable. If you\\'ve ever skipped the gym for a long time, then went back and did a big workout, it\\'s that kind of tender. I\\'m wearing my spanx today and that helps.\\n              \\n\\n              I\\'m a little worried about what may come. I see others saying that 3 - 4 days later they had lots of pain. One thing my doctor stressed to me was to NOT take Advil for anything, even a headache, during this process. Advil is an anti-inflammatory and one of the things that makes this treatment work is the body\\'s natural inflammation defense. In fact, I just watched a Dr. Oz clip about CoolSculpting where he explained that, too. My doctor recommended taking Tylenol if necessary, but no Advil. He also gave me his cell number and said if the pain gets really bad he\\'ll immediately phone in a prescription for a special painkiller, so I feel somewhat confident knowing I\\'m covered that way.\\n              \\n              So I\\'m less than 24-hours in and that\\'s all I have to share with you. My goal isn\\'t necessarily a flat stomach (although that would be nice), or even a tolerable bikini body. I just want to be able to sit down and not have my stomach fold up in two rolls. And if my bellybutton would go from being a frowny to being open, I\\'d like that too. Stay tuned for more.',\n",

       " {'body': 'My review will be spread out more than typical treatments as I need to approach this for personal scheduling reasons over a 4-week period for the initial 6 treatments, 2 at a time. My treatment area is the back flanks and bra line. I was told that I would need 6 areas and was a good candidate (not too overweight, 10 lbs within my target weight but this is not a weight reduction just inches of fat.\\n             \\n             I purchased 8 treatments for a discounted special but the “normal” price quoted for 8 treatments is $4500.00. I purchased the extra 2 for a second treatment wherever needed because I am on a budget here. That is precisely why I am doing the review because there are many women out there that are not in the wealthy class. For us this splurge to better our appearance is a big investment that we do not want to consider as a waste of money. I want to help you with that “taking a chance”. Often reviewers start and never finish and I can’t help but think the person wasn’t satisfied but didn’t want to insult the facility so they drop the final review.\\n             \\n             My first treatment experience was great (01/12). The front person I. and the RN D. were warm & professional. They both have a beautiful appearance but not the overdone look (sort of matters to me, it may not to you). D. who performed the procedure explained every step, there was minor discomfort and my anxiety level was low. That’s saying a lot! A week before hand and a week after, I stopped using ibuprofen, fish oil and alcohol, basically anything that was a blood thinner. I had no bruising. I used non-acetone fingernail polish remover to remove the permanent marker and arnica gel on the area for several days. There was a distinct 2” x 6” solid red patch that lasted about a week. Which brings me to a consideration that I didn’t know about; size. Apparently, there are different size suction tools that you are paying for so ask that question. The area felt fairly sore and numb for a good week and a half. Several times I took acetaminophen. At <3 weeks, prior to my second treatment I saw a slight reduction already because the lower flank area treated was smaller than the untreated flank above it (right below the waistline). So far, it’s looking promising but it is stated that results take up to one to three months.\\n             \\n             The second treatment experience was mostly the same; pleasant experience but the actual discomfort was almost nil. Afterwards there was no bruising and no redness either. Just a faint red outline that lasted a couple hours. For me, I followed the same before & aftercare as the first. Not sure at all why the difference but stay tuned…..',\n",

       " {'body': 'EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY COOLSCULPTING EXPERIENCE !!! DID NOT WORK & left me with physical pain & an empty bank account !!!! \\xa0First and foremost were you aware that if you\\'re unhappy with the results & your clinic won\\'t help, then you can file an official complaint with Zeltique ( the makers of the coolsculpting machine ) @ Www.coolsculpting.com. Your clinic will then be required to deal with your complaint regardless of their opinion. If Zeltique\\'s investigation proves there were no results and your clinic still refuses to acknowledge your disappointment, then you can report them to the \" Better Business Bureau\" in Canada or the U.S\\n             \\n\\n\\n              My first bit of advice to all of you out there is to do as much research on this topic as possible, there are literally thousands of posts out there with tons of unsatisfied clients. People like myself that ignored the info i read because i was so \"desperate\" to finally do something about the stubborn belly fat. My interest in this all began after my friend had a tummy tuck- paid $10G and was back to work soon after. \\xa0Can\\'t tell you how amazing her tight flat tummy immediately looked with minimal scaring, her ab muscles were even showing for the first time in her life !!! I wanted what she had but with less pain, less cost and less invasiveness. What i recieved instead was a great amount of pain during my 3procedures lasting 6 weeks afterwards ,including no results & a loss of almost 2 thousand dollars. \\xa0I\\'m a petite girl with a small tummy roll, so the technician ( not a Doctor or nurse i might ad in my situation - a coolsculpting \" technician\" only needs a training course offered by zeltique ) She decided that i was quite tiny & only required the smaller device which cost $750 plus tax instead of the large device (which the majority of patients use ) at a whopping cost of $ 2500 !!!!! My total loss was $1700.00 \\xa0but obviously could\\'ve been much worse.\\n             \\n\\n              The clinic eventually offered another treatment with the large device at no charge, so that totalled 3treatments in the same area with no results. The other VERY IMPORTANT thing to ad is\" DO NOT GO ON A DIET SUDDENLY & LOSE WEIGHT\" or it will give your treatment a FALSE positive result without a doubt. I read so many posts out there where people stated how happy they were with their results and looked so much better after losing 20-30-40 pounds on their diets during treatments. You can easily \"naturally\" melt fat off your body if you lost that kind of weight !!!! If your going to go ahead with the treatment anyway, then at least try the procedure without losing a pound first ( hold off your diet plan until the approximate three months waiting period is up-then you\\'ll know for sure if it was effective )\\xa0\\n             \\n\\n              I stayed the exact same weight throughout, but my third photosession was horrifying for some reason, the pics looked worse than before i started and the technician had the gall to ask if i had gained weight or was pushing my stomach out !!! Could\\'nt believe she accused me of such a thing & it was mortifying to say the least. She requested that i return at another time to retake photos, so i waited a month, made sure there was no chance of bloating- even avoided any salt for a week and didnt eat much. The day of retakes i had accidentally lost 8 pounds and was extremely upset because i know for a fact that 8 pounds on my small frame is a huge weight loss. The photos were still very disappointing & looked almost identical to the original. The technician told me at that point that i was among a few in their clinic that showed no results \\xa0( FYI the Dr. Later denied this statement for some reason). \\xa0\\n             \\n\\n              I\\'m positive my clinic would\\'ve left it at that had i not made an official complaint to Zeltique. The Dr. Asked to see me afterwards ( only because she was \"forced\" to ) and stated she also agreed with me regarding the fact that i had no results but she was going to wait until Zeltique made their decision before proceeding. It\\'s been a year since my first procedure & it took 2 final months to have this matter dealt with, but finally Zeltique phoned me today and said according to their opinion- they found results from the photos. So my Dr. Said there was nothing more she could do for me at that point/ case closed. My Dr. \" owns\" the clinic, I can assure you there was alot more she could\\'ve done if she truly cared, considering I had been a valuable ( profitable ) client there for many years and literally spent thousands & thousands of dollars. Will never return to Bella Sante Saskatoon again & will do everything possible to make sure people understand the risks involved in this \" questionable \" procedure.\\xa0\\n             \\n\\n              Coolsculpting has been around for many years now but why do you think only 3 clinics in all of Saskatchewan ( 1 here in Saskatoon )\\xa0offer this treatment and only a handful ( 8 since last checking) in all of Canada ????? \\xa0This is only one of the many comments from other clinics out there & the info basically states the \" truth\" about these machines. \\xa0There has been \" documented evidence\" by Dr.s stating that coolsculpting (otherwise known as Cryolipolysis ) has caused \"damage\" to the area & the patient was actually worse off after treatment ( will post the link when i find it again )\\n             \\n\\n              Coolsculpting will NOT tighten the skin, if it was dimply & saggy before, it will NOT CHANGE after treatment. As for each clinics before & after photos, they of course show their 1or 2 very effective patient online photos who may have spent upwards and over $10,000 getting their tummy areas, love handles thighs ect done but the ad certainly won\\'t tell you the immense cost involved. Challenge your clinic & ask them to show you all of their patients results ( photos are done from the neck down so there\\'s no reason why they cant show you results ) and ask what each person spent to achieve those results. It took my technician about 15min to come up with 2 photos ( that should\\'ve been my first clue that something was amiss). When they ask you to sign the \" waiver form\" before treatment, read it carefully and take it seriously, I experienced almost every symptom the form mentioned and could i really be that rare patient who these things just unfortunately happen to ???? \"No way\", \\xa0in my opinion, the technician totally sugarcoated the procedure, \\xa0when the device was applied to my belly, I slightly panicked and almost vomited !!! It was so intense and so tight that i could only take tiny short shallow breathes for the entire excruciating 60 minutes because it had most of my belly sucked into it\\'s massively powerful vortex. My pain threshold is high & I do not exaggerate, this experience was beyond painful !!!! \\xa0( Third treatment was slightly less painful than the first two ).\\n             \\n\\n\\n              Be forthright and ask your technician or Dr. What their clinic protocol is, if the procedure doesn\\'t work or your not satisfied...... wonder what their answer would be ? And if your already the \" poor sucker\" like myself who believed in this snake oil pitch & didn\\'t receive results, then PLEASE inform ZELTIQUE !!! Do you trust your clinic to officially provide that info to them ? I certainly would\\'nt ! \\xa0These clinics have a huge bill to pay off ( average Zeltique machine costs between $80- $100 thousand dollars ) so they have a deep invested interest in convincing you to have the treatment and or many treatments & avoid all negative publicity ) Zeltique , by law, must document all complaints & individual cases. Not sure when & where the public will ever get to hear those complaints though.\\n             \\n\\n\\n              So here is what i know at this point- my girlfriend spent $10 thousand dollars and received the most amazing tummy tuck i\\'ve ever seen. The results were immediate and her scares are hardly noticeable now ( she honestly experienced less pain that myself ). My other girlfriend ( who patiently waited to see my results ) decided against coolscuplting and instead recently spent $3000 on liposuction. Her tummy area looks great & she\\'s totally satisfied. She as well experienced less pain than i did and has a teeny almost invisible dot sized scare from the procedure. I lost almost $2000.00- have no results & went through 18 weeks of pain for absolutely nothing.\\n             \\n\\n\\n              If your wondering why i havent posted before/after photos of myself, it\\'s because the clinic refused to send them to me via email. I will try to eventually post my future 20 pound weight loss ( from 120 down to 100 pounds ) so you can clearly see what a huge difference weight loss has on the body& belly area ) once i\\'m at that point, my belly fat completely disappears. Just have to figure out how to stay at that weight consistantly, then i\\'ll have saved myself thousands of $$ the natural way.\\xa0\\n             \\n\\n\\n              P.S. I realize there are some people out there who have achieved legitimate results and i just wanted to say congratulations, i\\'m happy that you didn\\'t waste your money. This account is \" my own personal experience\" and i\\'m thankful for the opportunity to help and warn others about the possible side effects & complications of coolsculpting.\\n              \\n              Also wanted to mention that i\\'m a very positive person & never complain about much of anything. Life is awesome & i\\'ll soon get over this - even just writing it out & sharing my story has helped. I wish all of you the best regardless of what decision you make.\\xa0\\n              \\n              \" La Dolce Vita\"\\n              \\n              Sincerely,\\n              \\n              Dreamer..... from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Canada',\n",

       " {'body': 'After posting yesterday about my last Coolsculpting experience, it was killing me that I couldn`t show the public my before and after photos. Wish I would`ve taken my own through out the process, then I could`ve posted them all in sequence here for everyone to see. This is a picture I just managed to find tucked away that my clinic, \"Bella Sante Md Cosmetic & Laser Clinic\" took BEFORE any treatments were done ( left side ) I had to hold my hands up in the air so they did not distract from the picture which is why my rib cage was showing at the top. You`ll notice I have a clear formed definition where the obliques are. The photo to the right is a picture I took in my bathroom today showing that it was in fact today`s date March 25th 2013 by holding the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper in my hand. I work out regularly on a elliptical machine, mild weights and lots of stretching so I`ve never been that muscular, just toned. I honestly almost cried looking at these photos today because I completely forgot what my tummy looked like before I did this. I`ve worked out exactly the same since the first photo and I`m the exact same weight in both ( 120 pounds 5\"3 tall ) but OH MY GOD !!! Does it not look like my stomach muscles are totally gone and my belly seems to protrude more now that before. In fact I MUCH PREFER my before photos !!!! This is crazy, I had no idea it looked this bad !!!! Could I actually be one of those people that came out with worse results ?!?!?!\\n             \\n             Ok here come the tears.................this is truly unbelievable !!!!\\n             \\n\\n             P.S. I lost the complaint case with Zeltique for one reason. My clinic would not allow me to retake photos because of my accidental weight loss ( 8 pounds is huge ). But yet they insisted that I retake photos when it benefited them. So needless to say Zeltique said they noticed a very subtle improvement which was \"obviously\" only due to the weight loss and my Dr. knew that as well. If they could see these pictures now they would be as shocked as I am I`m sure',\n",

       " {'body': \"I decided to try cool-sculpting to get rid of my belly bulge after having twins. I'd done my homework, read the reviews and decided it was the best option for me since I didn't want to have surgery. All of the descriptions for cool-sculpting on doctor websites say that it's virtually painless and I am living proof that that's not the case. I realize that every individual reacts differently but I am in so much pain right now that I would've never done it if I had known it would be this bad. I had my procedure last Thursday and they applied 2 large applicators to my stomach. It was very uncomfortable and hard to sit still for 2 hours. The worst part was the massage afterwards. I would describe it as torture. The deep tissue massage was unlike nothing I've ever experienced. I almost passed out from the pain. After the pain subsided and I left the clinic I was numb and sore as if I'd been punched. My stomach was so swollen it looked like I was 5 months pregnant. I am on day 5 and the swelling has subsided slightly but I am still wearing a compression band. Yesterday, day 4, my nerve endings woke up, just like everyone else said they would. I have been in extreme pain since yesterday morning as it feels like my stomach is on fire. I took Neurontin last night to help with the pain. It helped somewhat and basically made me drowsy so I could sleep a bit. It doesn't get rid of the pain completely. It just lessens it. Today I am at work and can't take the medication because of the drowsiness so I am trying to cope by taking advil and tylenol which really isn't helping. I've had a C-section, septorhinoplasty, laproscopic surgery, and others and none of them have compared to this in terms of the pain. Even if I see good results in a couple of months, I will never do Coolsculpting again. Bottom line. Everyone reacts differently to this procedure so do your homework and be aware of the risks.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I got CoolSculpting 1 week ago from today. My upper body from the hips up needs a lot of work. I went in to get a consult and ended up getting a treatment that day. The technician said I needed 2 treatments (one now and another in 4 to 6 weeks after) on both areas. She used a large applicator on my lower and upper abs. She also said I would benefit getting it done later under my bra line. My plan was to get 2 treatments on stomach, 1 on flanks, bra line, and maybe under arms. After reading what everyone is going through, I'm very worried about going back. I thought I would post my thoughts and what my experience is.\\n             \\n\\n             The treatment itself was very weird at first but really wasn’t bad. The massage after wasn’t that bad either, kind of uncomfortable but not bad. The next morning I woke up to a swollen stomach and it was so numb. I had to go to work so I found a pair of dress pants that was a size larger than I wore, and prayed I would make it through the day wearing them. We are not allowed any leggings or yoga pants. After work, I went and bought me a pair of spanks and have been wearing them while I’m at work. On day 4, I started feeling a little of a prickly feeling in the treatment area, kind of feels like needles. I was still swollen and not seeing much improvement, and my lower ab feels hard. I read on some reviews that this could be called Paradoxical Hyperplasia (never heard of it, but I’m going to research it). Day 7 - I have noticed a little of the swelling is starting to go down, but I am still swollen and my lower ab is hard. Still wearing a size bigger in my pants. I have been massaging the lower ab as much as I could tolerate and using ice packs. Tonight I decided to buck up through the pain and really massage the hard area. This seems to have helped some with the hardness. I just pray that this is normal swelling and it’s gone by the end of week 2. I only have the before pictures today as I tried to take a selfie of the abdominal area and it turned out horrible. I will keep you all posted. Please let me know if any of you have experienced the same with swelling and how long did it take to go down. As for the pain, bottom line is, everyone experiences and processes pain differently, so please think about your pain threshold and not what others are experiencing.\",\n",

I'm hoping to have everything done by end of March and full results by June. I'm back to doing 2.5 miles a day and started adding some weight lifting in my routine.

My concern areas are: #1 Arms, #2 Abdomen, and #3 Flanks. I went in for a consultation for SculpSure after a consultation for CoolSculpting because I had heard from various people that SculpSure was better. However, I only could find SculpSure results on everything but arms so I did SculpSure on my tummy and went in this week for CoolSculpting on my arms. I\\'ve seen some pretty amazing CoolSculpting arms before and afters, but this area is harder to find since it is off-label for most of these machines.\\n             \\n\\n             This should be an interesting comparison to see how effective each one is, however, not entirely accurate because I got treatments on different areas.\\n             \\n\\n             I\\'ll review the actual center later, but here is how the procedure went. I was pretty worried about the pain levels after seeing reviews, but I think that helped me as I expected the worst and got...nothing near that. They situated me on a chair and got the pillows in the right places.\\n             \\n\\n             Next was putting the gel sheet (it was so cold!) on my right on and then turning on the machine. It felt just like you\\'d think it would feel - a cold suction. It was painful at all, they situated my arm nicely so I think that really helped in the comfort factor. They told me that I needed to let them know if my ring and pinky finger started to tingle so they could move it off of that main nerve. It did. They moved it, but it still tingled and eventually went to sleep. No big deal.\\n             \\n\\n             Relaxed and just read on my cell phone for 60 minutes and then it was time to pop off the machine and the dreaded \"massage.\" Again, not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It was so relieving. It was uncomfortable, but just felt like someone pushing on a tender bruise for a couple of minutes. I recommend trying to talk to whoever is there to take your mind off of it, that was helpful. My hand and fingers started to come back from numbness after that and it wasn\\'t too bad.\\n             \\n\\n             Next was left arm, same as the right except for some reason, massaging on this side was a bit more uncomfortable. Maybe because there is less fat?\\n             \\n\\n             Procedure over, totally easy, and I\\'m a baby when it comes to pain. Will be 100% worth it if it gives me the results I want.\\n             \\n\\n             Arms are pretty tender and sore today but was still easily able to work out. Just feels numb and bruised. They are both pretty swollen and bruised in a couple of places but I got some arnica gel so I\\'ll try that out.\\n             \\n\\n             I\\'ll include some before and during photos, but my stats are:\\n             \\n             Right Arm: 11.5in at largest area\\n             \\n             Left Arm: 11in at largest area\\n             \\n\\n             I am working out daily, eating clean, and drinking a ton of water - I hope this will speed up and maximize my results. I\\'ll keep you all updated! Wish me luck :)',\n",

Each took 35 mins. In terms of pain... It didn't hurt for me. It was definitely an odd sensation but not bad. The massage was what I was expecting. A little painful and I would rate it as maybe a 6/10 for pain.\\n             \\n\\n             The next day I woke up numb with lots of swelling.

I went on a couple runs, the elliptical, to the climbing gym, and rode my bike everywhere. Not what I was expecting to do. For me I didn't experience any painful late onset pain. I had a couple prickles here and there but they only lasted ten seconds or so.\\n             \\n\\n             My biggest concern right now is that the procedure didn't work since I didn't experience any major side effects and could exercise with ease.

I\\'m a 31 yr old mother of three. I\\'m 5\"5 and 130lbs. I am healthy and work out a few times a week but can\\'t get rid of my love handle area.\\n             \\n\\n             They say it\\'s not supposed to be painful but It was! She started out with my left side bra fat area. First she took before pictures and explained how it would feel. While standing she marked all the areas with permanent marker. She then applied the freezing cold gel pad that will definitely wake you up! Then she applied the suction while I was standing and it pulled me back a little. It felt like it was digging into my ribs and bruising me. It was mainly uncomfortable but the pressure that I felt against my bones hurt. Then she told me to carefully lay down on the bed/table. I had to be careful not to knock the suction off or else she would have to start it over. So I was lying on my right side for an hour, trying to get comfortable and thinking why the hell did I do this and how am I going to be able to go through this 5 more times today! Finally the machine started twitching and pulling itself off of me slowly and it was over. She said it might hurt a little to pull the machine off because of the suction. It was very painful and I have a high tolerance for pain. I was trying to close my eyes and bear it. Then it came to the worst part of the whole thing, the 2 minute massage! I knew that was the worst part of it from reading reviews and from the place telling me but It was way worse than I imagined. When that was over she asked me to stand up so she could put the gel pad on my right side and get that going. I stood up slowly and she pressed on the area that she just massaged and said you\\'re very swollen but that\\'s to be expected. I winced and she asked if it hurt and I said yes it\\'s very sore. Next thing I knew I woke up on the floor with two workers asking me if I was alright. I said what happened and they told me I had fainted! They called an ambulance because I tensed up my arms before I went down.\\n             \\n\\n             I don\\'t have a history of fainting but the intense pain shocked my body and my blood pressure dropped and cut off oxygen to my brain. This happened once before when someone accidentally kicked off my thumb nail. At that point I was scared to get up and my arm was hurting from the fall. I sat on the floor and they got me orange juice. They said I should have eaten before the procedure but I went so early in the morning that I didn\\'t have enough time to. They helped me up to sit back on the bed and brought me a wrap to eat. They didn\\'t feel it was safe to continue the other 5 treatments and told me to reschedule the other side for next week. Now I\\'m so nervous to go back and have to deal with the pain of this but I have to because I already did my right upper back and payed them in full.\\n             \\n\\n             Has anyone else fainted after cool sculpting? She told me it has happened before but usually when the person is getting their abdomen done and sitting on the bed. She said it looked like I was seizing the way I tensed my arms up.\\n             \\n\\n             The four love handle ones have to be done all together in the same day.

She would not do coolsculpting again to even the indent out because she said she doesn't have a smaller applicator piece and told me about fat transferring I could try in a couple months. This isn't what I agreed to. Nor do I feel like I should pay for additional procedures. I paid $1200 for poor results!! I believe the applicators were applied uneven to my arms to begin with since my bruises were in different spots. I feel like I entrusted my body to someone who is now giving me the cold shoulder and not fixing her error.

We talked (me and someone at office) for the next few days after my procedure and I was given pain medication due to my excruciating pain however it certainly wasn't their first resort. We are thinking that my previous surgeries may have left scar tissue that made this a bit more painful for me.\\n             \\n\\n             Pain update- yesterday, was not as bad as the infamous day 7, but I did still have the nerve pain as well as the site pain.

Honestly, the suction was a little uncomfortable but not bad. I had my left flank and right lower ab done first. When the left flank came off after an hour, I was not at all prepared for the amount of pain I felt during the massage and directly following. I felt light headed (from not breathing correctly) and almost cried, just overall awful. I was thinking, 'Shit! this is only the first part, how am I going to keep doing this?' The nurse had to apply extra pressure to the areas after for me to get to a point where I could handle the discomfort. But it does subside eventually. I did the right flank and left lower ab next, then I did each upper ab separately. Due to my pain reaction, I needed extra time between treatments, so from the time I arrived in the morning and the time I finally was able to leave, I was there almost 6 hours total. 4 of which were with applicators. I got better with breathing during the massages, a big breath then count 2-3 on the exhale. But the pain was still a lot. I'm not sure I can do a second treatment if I end up needing one, but I'll come to that path down the road.\\n             \\n\\n             The next day, my treated area is very swollen at first, and I can't really suck in my belly so I feel bigger than usual. It is certainly sore, mostly in the middle where there was overlapping of treatment sites. I'm taking ibuprofen and using a heating pad when I'm sitting still. I'm also wearing spanx most of the time to keep the area compressed. At work, I notice the soreness and numbness most when bending down and using the bathroom. I'm on my feet all day and the soreness didn't keep me from moving too much.\",\n",

Initially noticed a slight reduction, not significant enough to say it was worth it. very small difference during the first month, there after it seemed the fat started concentrating around center. Went back to do the same procedure a year later. No change second time around. 4800 total not worth it in the end. Ended up getting lipo done. Results of that were fantastic, that seemed the best option for me. Wish that the 4800 would have gone towards lipo. Nothing I can do about it.

       " {'body': \"Having seen all the reviews on it, I was extremely excited when I finally was able to try the CoolSculpting when it became available by two doctors I trust immensely. I decided I wanted to write about my experience the whole way through. First, I will be honest, it was semi awkward to strip down in front of two doctors I know well and have them poke and pull at my fat. A little background on me, I am 5'6'' 136 pounds. I actively work out but like many have that stubborn belly pooch and love handles. I already knew I wanted to target my love handles first (I full intend to do my abdomen later on). After getting all marked up for the two areas on each side on my love handles (4 areas total) I got prepped to have the machine put on. First they put a VERY cold patch on the first area to be treated. This patch is to prevent you as the patient from getting hurt at all if the machine malfunctions in anyway. It is sort of like a barrier. To be honest, this was the hardest part of the procedure, it is DAMN COLD. After that, they had me sit on the chair and applied the machine and turned the suction on. It is definitely a strange feeling but completely tolerable. I then laid down, positioned myself comfortably and they turned the cold on. Again the pain, if i'd even call it that, was completely tolerable and after 5 minutes, I was completely numb. 60 minutes later they removed the machine, hurts for a small second as they pull it off but then completely fine and the docs massaged out the butter like lump. This was a tad uncomfortable and I definitely gritted my teeth a bit at certain parts but it did feel a little good towards the end to have the coldness rubbed out. I flipped over and did the second side then, same routine. I only did 2 of the 4 areas to start (it takes an hour per area so I needed to get back to work at some point). Immediately after the procedure it was clear I was going to bruise as a small bruise had already begun to form, but it just looked like a gigantic hickey. The next few hours I was numb and it kind of just felt foreign to touch the areas. That night, I will admit I had some trouble sleeping (I fell asleep just fine but was woken up by my dog getting sick around 2:30 am) and at that point the tenderness had set in and as a side sleeper, it was a little hard to get comfortable. I'm sure if I had taken some Tylenol I would have been fine but I was lazy about getting up and just dealt with the discomfort.\\n             \\n             Day 2- Could have woken up and gone to the gym and worked out but decided to take it easy just in case. Went to work as normal and worked a full 8 hours with no discomfort or pain at all. Putting leggings on did feel a little strange but no pain whatsoever. Will be interesting to see how tonight goes! Will update in the morning\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I have always had a tummy pooch in my lower stomach area and have not been able to wear form fitting dresses. I am slender, but that area has bothered me forever. I had a consultation with Dr. Chiu to discuss CoolSculpting and he found me to be an ideal candidate for the procedure. He fully explained what I should expect during and after the procedure. The total time of the treatment was 2 hours and it was in the office. The initial application of the machine was cold and I felt a lot of pressure, but after a few minutes, the area went numb and I just sat there and watched a TV series, sipped on a beverage, and cozied up in a plush blanket they provided. After the treatment was completed, they had to massage the area and that was painful, but not so much that I couldn't handle it and I am a complete baby when it comes to pain. The area was swollen and tender to the touch, but it got better everyday over a two week period. I did have to wear looser clothing so they wouldn't press up against the treatment area and I slept on my back. I went straight back to work after the treatment though and no one had a clue I had something done. I must say, the results are amazing! My pooch is virtually gone and my side profile has improved so much. The staff was wonderful and always checked on me...made me feel comfortable and cared for. I also received fabulous follow up care from Dr. Chiu. He is such a nice person as well as incredibly knowledgeable and fully explained why this treatment was a great option for me. This treatment was well worth the money and little bit of discomfort.\",\n",

It's only slightly uncomfortable for the first minute then it goes more numb. I had very minimal bruising on my thigh for a couple of days. It is a little sore and the numbing can last a few weeks after treatment. I left the appointment and went straight to the gym, no downtime!

Both areas were treated in the same day. The application of the coolsculpting machine wasn't too bad. I did experience some discomfort after the applicator was removed, but it only lasted about 10 minutes. I had no bruising. Some slight swelling over my flanks was noticed for about 2 weeks. the area was also slightly numb to the touch for about 3 weeks. I feel that I achieved my results at the 4 week post treatment mark. I am considering my inner thighs now.\",\n",

Today we did 4 small applicators in a diamond shape around my abdomen.\\n             \\n\\n             Keeping in mind that I have a very low tolerance for discomfort and pain, I was pleasantly surprised! The first application (my lower left side) wasn't much of anything....not even the first few seconds. Keep in mind I had god awful cramps from day 2 of my period (the kind that keep you in bed unless you gobble 3 Advil ever 3.5 hours) so i did take 3 Advil beforehand. Had I not been in such pain before the procedure, I wouldn't have taken a pain reliever.\\n             \\n             The massage of the butter stick was uncomfortable, but I definitely would not call it painful. And I find everything to be painful! However, afterward I had to make a run to the ladies room. That's when things got bad.\\n             \\n             I have hypoglycemia which for some reason is exacerbated by stress. Halfway to the lady's room my vision went black and I knew I had to either Lay flat on my back, or I'd pass out and vomit. I chose to skip the restroom break and go back to the procedure table. My nurse encouraged me to stop there, but I knew I'd be fine as long as I laid down.\\n             \\n             Second application went on my lower right side. As it overlapped a bit with the first application, it was a little more uncomfortable, but not bad at all.\\n             \\n             The 2 upper ab locations were considerably more uncomfortable, but after 2 minutes they got numb and were fine.\\n             \\n             Now I'm home, rocking a pair of Spanx. I get a few little shocks every 5-10 minutes, and the skin is sore if I touch it, but I'm bouncing around the house, sipping champagne and feeling awesome.\\n             \\n             My nurse sent me home with a script for neurotin for the more-common-than-reported late onset pain. I also procured all kinds of compression garments, ice packs and a tube of aspercream. I could not convince them into a Vicodin rx, but I read elsewhere that won't do much to relieve pain, only to help you sleep. I have Xanax and ambien Rx's for that anyway.\\n             \\n             I know from reading these posts that the worst is yet to come, but I'm very happy about my surprising lack of pain.

Then the suction - it was very intense for me for about 10 minutes, not really pain so much but the feeling and the strong suction really bothered me at first. After the 10 minutes, it felt like a mild cramp. I did some work on my iPad until that hour was up. When the suction was released, they massaged the area which hurt but more of just in a sore kind of way and not pain.\\n              \\n\\n              Then the flanks.

I had also brought a Nook and just read because I was afraid to move and loose the suction. After the suction was released, each side hurt more of in a painful way for about 10 minutes then felt quite a bit better. I had immediate bruising on my sides - large bruises, but was expecting bruising as I bruise pretty easily. All areas were numb and swollen the rest of the day. I worked out the evening I had it done and did my normal weights and cardio with the exception of ab exercises - I was too sore to do those.\\n              \\n\\n              On Day 2, my sides were very sore and I had even more bruising. My stomach didn't really bother me much and I had no bruising there. Did cardio and found that swimming laps actually felt good, maybe because the pool is cool. All areas were numb and swollen all day.\\n              \\n\\n              On Day 3, the bruising on my sides looked a little better, still no bruising on stomach. My sides hurt a little less, but my stomach was more sore, not in a painful way, more of like I did too much ab work at the gym. The numbness is still there and I still have swelling. I did my normal weight and cardio and did most of my ab routine without any trouble, just some soreness.\\n              \\n\\n              The only trouble I have had is with sleeping. I sleep on my side and have insomnia, so I haven't been able to get comfortable.\\n              \\n\\n              I am optimistic that this will work once the swelling goes down. I will report on a weekly basis and will post before and after pictures/measurements after a month.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"After my second c-section I was left with this 'ledge' or 'hang'- and it depressed me. Even at my heaviest, I have never had a hanging stomach. I gained quite a bit of weight with my two pregnancies and I was able to lose a lot quickly but my stomach had this hanging thing.\\n             \\n             I was convinced that I wanted to get a tummy tuck, but after doing research I started looking at coolsculpting. I just didn't have the time off from work to get a tummy tuck. Plus I was told that I would not be able to pick up my two kids.\\n             \\n             I will admit- if I wasn't working and I had someone to help me with the kids fulltime I would have opted for a tummy tuck.\\n             \\n\\n             On March 27 I had my CS procedure done. I did 4 areas, to upper and 2 lower abs. My dermatologist had the new applicators in and told me that the new applicators were not as painful. She was right, I had almost no pain, I even stopped her to ask if that was normal because I after all the reading I had done I was expecting a lot of pain and pulling. The new applicators only require 35 mins. I did not have the 'stick of butter' effect and again, I voiced my concern and I was told it was ok.\\n             \\n\\n             After the procedure, I was beyond swollen. In fact- I was swollen for about 3 weeks. To the point where I was Googling my side effects. FYI- never start Googling 'swollen abdomen' at 1 am. The Internet will have you convinced that you have a terminal illness that will only be cured by drinking warm organic lemon water and covering your feet with raw onions.\\n             \\n\\n             After about 1 month, I finally started to see results. 3 months later, I see results but I decided to have a second round done.\\n             \\n\\n             If you are thinking of doing this procedure, make sure you take pics every week. It's easy to get discouraged, the pics will help you see tiny changes.\\n             \\n\\n             If you are going to get more than one round done in the same area, you might want to consider lipo/surgery. It will end up costing you about the same amount. For me- the big draw to CS was not having any downtime. If you have kids- you know you can't be bedridden for weeks.\\n             \\n\\n             The results aren't drastic, but I knew that I wasn't going to get major results. But to me- anything is better than this 'hang'.\",\n",

The RN arranged the treatment areas in a diamond shape that included 2 lower abdominal and 2 mid abdominal applications and then 2 for the flank areas.

It felt like an odd pulling/pressure sensation to begin with and then within 15-20 minutes the area was mostly numb. By the time the applicator was removed and the area was massaged it began to tingle and felt almost the same as when blood returns to a numbed body part.

       " {'body': 'I\\'m a healthy early sixties male with a very active lifestyle. I had/still have some lower abdominal belly fat and love handles. I went to Dr Posner for tumescent liposuction. I have several friends who have had this from different Docs, with good results. Posner immediately said that he had something better...Cool Sculpting or \"Zeltiq\". I was hesitant since tum lipo has been around a long time and I\\'ve seen it work. But no, Posner said that Zeltiq was the latest and greatest thing and that it would work for me. He was a very slick salesman. He even went so far as to say that once he was finished with me, that he would have no trouble fixing up a blond, blue-eyed, muscular gentile (yes, he used that word) with \"lots of nice girls in Boca\". Well, I didn\\'t go to him for dating advice, but he also said that since Zeltiq was very new, if it didn\\'t work, he\\'d re-do it at no charge. So, OK. Procedure was December 2012. By 7 week follow-up in February, no change. By 13 week follow-up still no change. Took photos, compared with initial, no change. He came into exam room, hadn\\'t even looked at new photos. He said \"Boca women will love you anyway\" Very insulting and degrading comment, particularly since he already had my $2650. I asked him about a re-do as he was trotting out the door, he said that \"one of my girls will call\". None ever did. During the next week there were several back-and-forth calls, finally with an offer to re-do for $1785. I declined. Well, after several months of waiting, follow-ups with no changes, and some pressure applied by me, he finally scheduled the re-do for June 2013. On the re-do day, he didn\\'t show up. The nice nurse did the procedure as described. As of now, there has been no change. I\\'m 6\\', 210. I eat 1800-2000 calories a day and work out hard 5 days a week. I have a 48\" chest and 15\" upper arms. My legs are tight and muscular. I do cardio. Don\\'t tell me that I\\'m unfit...I just have this stubborn midsection fat, part of being over 60. I wanted it gone, but I\\'m sure as heck not going back to Posner. God only knows what he would do to me if I were unconscious. I feel ripped off and used. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m a \"gentile\". Really?',\n",

The price is somewhat reasonable. I received 2 large treatments on my lower abdomen, which was actually split into 2 days.\\n             \\n             The first day, I almost thought about telling them to turn off the machine and give me my money back. As a nurse, I understand some sort of pain would be involved, but I didn't expect how bad it was. The first 5-10 were excruciating. After that, there was still a dull pain throughout the entire 60 minutes.\\n             \\n             Just when I thought I would be good, the dreaded massage came. I don't know what was worse, the initial pain or massage. Overall though, I'm optimistic about seeing great results. Right now, I'm just sore and bruised all over. Give it a few months with some increased exercise and healthy eating and hopefully all the pain and battle scars will be worth it!\",\n",

That was a total of 4 cycles which cost me $2520.00. The procedure was long (3-4 hours), uncomfortable and at times painful. After the procedure I was red, slightly bruised and numb. It took several months before the numbness went away. There were no changes in the areas treated other than what I just mentioned. I had zero results and was extremely disappointed. Ideal Image didn’t offer me anything except an apology. They told me I would have to purchase additional cycles, at the same cost, in order to see results. I personally feel it’s a complete scam.

The place itself has a beautifully relaxing, spa-like feel, and the staff was amazing...welcoming, accommodating and professional. They thoroughly explained how the technology works. The treatment itself was pretty easy... I watched a movie until my bra-line fat was frozen. I really only felt cold -no pain or discomfort- the entire time. They wrapped me in a cozy blanket and gave me hot tea to drink. All in all i felt very pampered. The hard part was waiting to see the results! It takes 2-4 months, and sure enough, right at the 2 month mark that fat roll was gone! It worked so well I just went back and CoolSculpted my chin. It's only been a couple weeks, but I will update when I see the results of that treatment.\\n             \\n             CoolSculpting really works, and BODIFY is truly a first class place to have it done.

I\\'m a size 4, 135 lbs and I always seem to have a little extra weight in my lower stomach, especially after I had my son 2 years ago. The procedure itself was pretty painless except for when they initially suck the skin into the machine. It hurt more than I expected, but it was only for a few seconds. Your stomach gets numb and as you are sitting through the procedure, it isn\\'t uncomfortable at all.\\n             \\n\\n             My stomach was numb for the first few days or so. Then it seemed like the nerves started to \"wake up\" from being frozen and I started getting shooting/stabbing nerve pain. It was so bad at times that it woke me up in the middle of the night! I was also on vacation so it wasn\\'t ideal. I notified the doctors office and they gave me a prescription for Neurontin which almost immediately stopped the nerve pain. They said that only 5% of people experience this problem with nerve pain. I\\'m still waiting to see if there are results. I feel a little bit slimmer two weeks out, but I\\'ve been trying to improve my diet as well. If I don\\'t see great results in the future, I couldn\\'t recommend this procedure. The nerve pain was AWFUL and it is not relieved by any over the counter medications. I think I have a pretty decent pain tolerance and it was pretty unbearable at times (thought it is not consistent, it comes in waves).

It takes about 60-90 days. The procedure was easy, pretty painless and I have minimum bruising and swelling. As of today I am fairly pain free, mostly just tender. Janelle and Christine who performed the procedure are amazing. The staff at Pure Dermatology makes you feel like you have known them forever. I will post more as I start to see changes.

It was driving me nuts to suddenly have this belly appear.\\n              \\n              On June 21 I had cool sculpting performed at my Dermatologist office on my belly area. As others have mentioned it is shocking how much it sucks you in to the machine but certainly not painful or anything. I did feel as though I had to whisper and not inhale/exhale to deeply for fear it would pop off. In about 8 minutes I was totally comfortable. I had brought my Ipad and sat and read a book. Truly, I thought it was a piece of cake. When my time was up, I was dreading them taking me off of the suction because I had heard that it hurts when they massage the area.\\n              \\n              My belly looked like a giant stick of frozen butter - the nurse said she had never seen one as frozen as mine. She started to massage and yes, it is definitely uncomfortable but not screaming agony or anything. I then got up, got dressed and went shopping and resumed my day. By the end of the day my belly was very tender and very swollen. Again though, completely manageable. For 2 or so weeks my belly was still fatter than my original size and sore. Not only is it tender but ITCHY! I just put it out of my mind and kept telling myself that it is only temporary and it will be worth it. Some people have said how horrible it is, I would not say that at all, simply uncomfortable at times.\\n              \\n              I am now a little over 3 weeks since I had it done. I can see that definitely my belly is going down in size and I only have a very slight itching, no pain. I am confident that I am going to have good results. In fact, I have scheduled to have my love handles done too! I wish I had photos to share but unfortunately I didn\\'t think to take before pix. I am going to ask when I go back in (at the 3 month mark) to see if they will email me my before picture that they took.',\n",

I have kept the extra pounds on and as a result have my pooch and side flab back. I have since moved from Montana to Illinois and went to someone different for Cool Sculpting. Had it done today on my belly and each side. They have a couple machines so I was able to do it all in one day. Same as before, a piece of cake! minimal soreness right after we got done but now its numb. I know I can expect more soreness tomorrow and at some point the intense itchy-ness will start.

I tried all types of exercises (including boot camp) only to see myself lose fat everywhere else except on my belly. I have a young child and could not take even a day to recover from any treatments. So, I was excited when I found out about Coolsculpting. The treatment took only an hour and there was no down time. I went about my day afterwards. As for the pain, I didn't feel any pain during the treatment - just little bit of discomfort. It felt as like there was an ice pack on me. After the treatment, I did feel tingling off and on for a week. I must say the first treatment I had was with a very untrained staff in Beverly Hills and I did not see much results. However, I went to another doctor's office (Oliak Center for Weight Loss in Brea) and the physician assistant, Allie, knew exactly where to place the cooling panel to get maximum results. I realize now that my fat pockets are a bit slanted and the Allie knew exactly how to place it. She actually had a sixth sense about where to place the panels and which panels would work the best. After 4 months, that stubborn belly fat that I've been struggling with for so many years is gone. I loved it so much I went back to do my lower back with once again great results. I always had creases on my back where my waist is and those are gone as well! I highly recommend it but choose your doctor carefully for the best results. Otherwise, you are just wasting your money.\",\n",

I have an hour glass shape and a great waist, but my thighs never seemed to match my upper body. Even at my skinniest, I always felt my thighs were still thicker than the rest of me. A couple of months ago I attended an open house of Bridgetown Aesthetics in Portland, Oregon where the coolsculpting representative explained the procedure. I entered into a 1 free sculpting drawing and won it! Because I chose to do thighs and I got 1 free procedure, I had to pay for the second one $750. I chose to do my outer thighs. Ideally I would love to have my inner thighs done also, but that will just have to wait its turn. The outer thighs take 2 hours on each side or 4 hours total plus extra time for \"before\" pictures, measurements, paperwork, restroom break between the thighs, etc.\\n             \\n             Today was the procedure day. I was super excited. It felt a bit intense for a few brief minutes after the applicator was applied as the ice was doing its magic on my thigh, but soon after the \"pain\" went away and I didn\\'t feel anything. It wasn\\'t super comfortable laying there for a total of 4 hours. But the aesthetician Melody was super nice and made sure I had everything I needed, including movies to watch or something to read. I was content with my smart phone for entertainment and when it started to lose charge, she went and found me a charger. How nice is that! After the applicator was removed from my right thigh, she massaged the area and let me use the restroom as she set up to do my other side. My treated side felt a bit sore but it only lasted minutes. However after my self side was done, I felt a lot more sore. So much that I walked funny back to my car. It felt sore and intense for about 10-15 minutes, but then it felt totally normal. I am writing this review a few hours after my appointment and feel totally fine. We\\'ll see about tomorrow. My follow-up appointment will be in two months where after pictures and after measurements will be taken. I am very hopeful and excited to see results.',\n",

       " {'body': \"I had CoolScultping done on my upper and lower abs after having had two babies in two years and being transformed from having the athletic figure of a dancer to having a substantial mummy tummy. I wanted to get back on stage and so needed to diet to get back into shape. The only problem was my husband liked my new curvier frame preferring it to the muscular skinny physique I had previously sported. We decided upon a compromise. I would only lose half the weight that I wanted to going from 9st 13lbs- 9st 7lbs, rather than the 9st 2lbs I would prefer to be, so long as I could be rid of the mummy tummy.\\n              \\n\\n              After much research, I came to the conclusion that Coolsculpting was the way forward and so 15 months after the birth of my second child I bit the bullet and had the procedure done on my upper and lower abs. I had the procedure done in Simon Lee's Aesthetic Medical Clinic in Bristol.\\n              \\n\\n              Six weeks later I can honestly say that have I experienced more than a 30 percent reduction in the thickness of fat in the areas treated. My tummy is now now completely flat from the side and I can easily fit into my pre-pregnancy size 12 jeans.\\n              \\n\\n              I also lost 4lbs after the treatment by cutting out alcohol and drinking more water and this enhanced the effect, but by no means could be considered the reason for the new appearance of a flat stomach. I've never had a flat stomach, not even when I weighed 8st.\\n              \\n\\n              I also took before and after measurements of the area. They were 29 waist, 37 drop waist and 38 hip before, followed by a 28 waist, 35 drop waist, and 38 hip after. So it is obvious to see in the figures that it was spot reduction of the mummy tummy that was most significant.\\n              \\n\\n              I found the procedure itself odd but not unpleasant. The immediate sucking action of the applicator head is the most startling, followed by an intense cold, but it is soon replaced by a complete numbing of the area. I had slightly pink skin for a day afterwards and it felt tender to touch, but did not stop me from going about the daily chores required of me with two babies under three.\\n              \\n\\n              I did experience intense itching and bee sting like pains in the area on days 5-10 and did not feel up to doing any exercise on these days but these symptoms passed by day ten. It is six weeks since I had the procedure and I still have the sensation of having a slightly numb tummy, but only if I really concentrate on it. I took paracetamol during days 5-10, although this had little impact upon the bee-sting like pains, but as they were not severe in nature I was not perturbed. Rather it was annoying as I found it difficult to sleep through. I did call the Clinic's manager on day six to find out if I could take anything else and was given advice about further pain relief, which it turned out I didn't need in the end anyway.\\n              \\n\\n              The staff at the clinic were friendly, knowledgeable and reassuring. I'm sure I've never been offered so many cups of tea during a beauty treatment! I am considering treating my love handles in the future as I am one hundred percent convinced this procedure works for me.\",\n",

       " {'body': \"I gained weight the last two years in my midsection. I was caring for my terminally ill husband then when he died I went into depression. I wanted a jumpstart to a better body. I had been exercising but not achieving the results I wanted fast enough.\\n             \\n\\n             Went to what I would call a pop-up medical spa after a lot of searching and consultations as they were offering a discount.\\n             \\n\\n             I noticed during the consultation that on the wall of certificates everyone got theirs in 2017. Hmm. At the price I paid, I expected a nurse to administer the coolsculpting but I got a 'coolsculpting tech'.\\n             \\n\\n             I got my upper and lower abdomen and flanks done. My session was broken up into 3 parts as they did not have enough applicators to cover all of the areas at one time. I was told I was not wide enough for the large applicator.\\n             \\n\\n             I thought I had a high threshold for pain but not enough for this device. I took a vicodin right before I walked into the spa. I supposed if I were fatter, I may not have felt much. It was very uncomfortable at first especially due to the angle the vacuum was placed on my right flank. It was leaning on my hip bone. After about 10 minutes, the pain was bearable. After she pulled up the suction device, she massaged the area. That was definitely painful. To make matters worse, she used a HOT wet towel (!) to wipe (!) the sticky gel away from my skin. The act of vigorously wiping raw frostbitten skin is like freshly mauled skin. Felt like she poured rubbing alcohol on a huge wound. It really, really stung badly.\\n             \\n\\n             After part 1, I went to the bathroom. Standing up was a strange, painful experience. She previously said I would feel like I had done a lot of sit-ups. Bad analogy. I have done exercise sessions where I did way too many sit-ups. This feeling I had then was NOT that at all. It really feels like someone beat you up squarely in the ab region with a wood plank. I was nearly bent over at a 90 degree angle struggling to get to the bathroom. Instead of walking me over, she pointed down the hallway to where it was. It felt like a city block I was in so much pain. I should have been escorted in a wheelchair really. I didn't think I was going to make it back to the room.\\n             \\n\\n             The second time around I requested she not use a hot towel. By the 3rd part, it was quite painful. I asked her to remove one of the suction cups but she said she couldn't as it would constitute a 'session' which they could not receive a refund for. Something about cards being inserted into the machine instead of an on/off button. Though i was nearly in tears, I let it stay on but asked her to wait in the room in case it was too unbearable.\\n             \\n\\n             I had to take a second vicodin after part 2 of the session btw.\\n             \\n\\n             Surprisingly, I was able to walk out of there. My stomach definitely hurt afterwards though. It was sensitive to the touch and felt bruised allover though I didn't see bluish areas.\\n             \\n\\n             Later that evening I ran my handheld massager over the area just in case the 2 minute massages I received at the spa did not get at all of the frozen fat cells.\\n             \\n\\n             Glad I didn't schedule any meetings like I had intended to do for that afternoon. I was in too much pain and on too much vicodin to walk a lot or talk to people.\\n             \\n\\n             The next day I was able to go to on-site meetings but sitting, getting in and out of the car was painful. My skin was super-sensitive. The tech said she would followup with me the following day. Nearly 2 weeks now and she still hasn't called to check on me.\\n             \\n\\n             My skin was very numb for 3 days afterwards. My stomach felt like there were hard 1 inch sections. As I write this review about 2 weeks later, my skin is still numb but not as much. Still feel the hard sections when I bend over slightly or twist.\\n             \\n\\n             Will update with photos.\",\n",

       " {'body': 'I had cool sculpting done yesterday on my upper arms (dreadful tricep area) and back (more dreadful bra strap fat). The procedure went well and the nurse practitioner who saw me through the process was nothing short of 100% wonderful. I didn\\'t find it painful, just really an odd sensation. Today, one day post procedure, I am quite uncomfortable. I had trouble sleeping last \\xa0because I couldn\\'t get comfortable. I am massaging the areas 2x daily to help loosen the dead fat cells, which was the recommendation of the clinic-this is very VERY uncomfortable at this stage but I am trying to muscle through it because it\\'s said to produce better overall results. I am bruised and swollen and the areas that were frozen feel numb to light touch, while also feeling very hard and solid and there is the sensation of deep bruising. I am hoping the numbness begins to wear off soon and that the swelling/lumpiness subsides because it\\'ll be hard to monitor my results. I chose this clinic because it\\'s professional and I trust the staff there 100%. I appreciate that they take the approach of improving \"the total body image\" because making any one area smaller or more slim might not look right and sometimes we can\\'t see the whole picture. I went in for my tummy and so appreciated the honesty at my consult when I was told that my tummy is more of a lipo situation and that I wouldn\\'t be happy with the results if I proceeded with that area....so arms and bra fat it was. Because they were honest I feel as though I\\'ll have good results with the areas I had done because I truly don\\'t think they\\'d do it if I wasn\\'t a clear candidate. \\xa0I chose this procedure over other more invasive options because I like that there isn\\'t much down time to the recovery...yet, yesterday and today I\\'ve been extremely cautious ( afraid to bump into anything etc) \\xa0and don\\'t feel like a run on the treadmill will be comfortable. Doable, yes. Comfortable? NO! Stay tuned for updates and pictures! I am hopeful!',\n",

       " {'body': 'About 3 years ago I met my weight loss goal of -65 lbs to get to a normal healthy weight :-) This was done over a year and a half and was really through diet/exercise and I\\'ll be honest, a ton of hard work changing habits and thought patterns. No magic there.\\n             \\n\\n              So finally at my \\'ideal weight\\' (5\\'4\" ~140) athletic build, I feel pretty good about myself. Now here it comes.... I STILL have that belly fat. Even after all my fitness and dieting I find that my belly fat (spare tire, muffin top, insert your favorite here) just won\\'t leave. I am clearly apple shaped and the belly fat has been one of my most frustrating things to accept. But who needs to accept it when you can FREEZE IT OFF!?\\n             \\n\\n              When I realized that CoolSculpt was a thing, I immediately got online to do my research; and not through CoolSculpt either. I mean I\\'m aware how companies market. That brought me to sites like Realself and other bloggers about the success they have had.\\n             \\n\\n              Okay, next step was to find a place and get the consultation. Now here is where you have to be careful people. Do yourself a favor and find a BOARD CERTIFIED LICENSED PLASTIC SURGEON. There are a lot of places that will hook you up to the machine and let it freeze away the fat; and maybe they are cheaper and who knows you might be okay.... but think about your \\'worst case scenario\\' you thought about before considering this procedure... (got one?) who do you want to treat you in the event that this happens? A real MD who went to medical school and trained in plastic surgery or a cosmetic surgeon with no medical degree who only has a few years schooling? I\\'ll take the licensed plastic surgeon any day. They have more knowledge to treat the unexpected events as well as have the experience to evaluate and take care of your body as a medical professional. In my opinion, there is no other choice.\\n             \\n\\n              I found Noone Plastic Surgery in Bryn Mawr, PA\\n             \\n\\n              It was in my greater Philadelphia area, is CoolSculpt certified (by the manufactures) and the MD\\'s are board certified in plastic surgery. I signed up immediately for a consultation and after three areas now treated, have not been disappointed!\\n             \\n\\n              I had the MAX applicator done in September to my lower belly area (under the belly button) and then in early October I had my top stomach area done (right under my breasts). It is now mid November and I can already see results in both areas. The bottom has much less bulk and volume! The upper tummy used to have these fat pouches underneath my breasts that were SO flabby and irritating. They are much less pronounced and flabby!! I am so happy I did CoolSculpt. The fat will continue to die off for another month or so.... I can\\'t wait to see the final results.\\n             \\n\\n              The procedure itself was not that painful. It\\'s not comfortable but I mean who is expecting that? It feels like you are being vacuumed up and you can feel the pressure of the suction. But once it freezes (first 10 minutes or so) you literally feel almost nothing but the weight of the applicator. Then after they take the applicator off and massage your frozen fat back into your body.... okay now that hurts a bit. I won\\'t lie. Again, it is not pleasant but totally worth it. I think the most painful part is when your body starts warming back up to normal temperature.... those 2-3 minutes are about the worst. I like to jump around and rub other parts of my body to distract myself. But know once you get through the 3 minutes you are done with the worst of it!!! After that it is all recovery and downhill... die fat cells die!',\n",

Much of the deciding factor was the ability to remain awake, and the idea of very little downtown.\\n             \\n\\n             I went in for a free consultation and learned that I was the perfect candidate for it, as I had enough squeezable fat to indicate i would very likely get great suction from the applicators, and ultimately amazing results.\\n             \\n\\n             On May 7th, I went in to have 4 areas treated with 1 treatment each. I received treatment on both sides of my upper and lower abdomen. The specialist began with my lower left abdomen. On my LLA there was very little discomfort. I could feel the pressure of the suction, but I did not feel the area go numb. Upon removal it looked like a big red stick of better (as previous results have stated). The massage process was slightly uncomfortable, I could feel my skin warming up and the area beginning to tingle. My LRA was pretty much the same... Little discomfort, little pain. We then continued on with my Upper Right abdomen....this is where discomfort began to set in.. My guess is because I had less fat in my upper abdomen area. The suction was more intense (although the settings were the same) and upon removal of the suction, the area was very sore, and the massage was slightly painful. The same went for my ULA.\\n             \\n\\n             Post procedure as my entire abdomen began to thaw I could feel a slight tingle from my skin heating back up, but nothing unbearable. The specialist advised that I wear a compression garment such as a SPANX or waist trainer everyday for the first week to aid in swelling reduction , and lessen the discomfort I may feel as my stomach continued to thaw.\\n             \\n\\n             So far there have been 2 things really keeping the discomfort level down... 1.

       " {'body': \"I started going to Buckhead Facial Plastic surgery a little more than a year ago my initial consultation was for CoolSculpting which I had done on two areas and love the results. It was more than the results though. The staff really took the time to explain to me how CoolSculpting worked and what I could expect after. Not only that but I was given their email address so that I could contact them even if it was after hours and they were very attentive and made sure all of my needs were met. When I came back to see my results from CoolSculpting I was thrilled. During my CoolSculpting I mentioned that I was unhappy with some lines around my eyes and four head and Kristi told me about Botox. What I love most about our conversation is she wasn't pushy. She simply told me the information and let me make my own decision. When I had the Botox again I was thrilled from that point forward I was hooked. Buckhead Facial plastic surgery is one of my favorite places to visit. Dr Jarmuz and her staff are very thorough. Since then I've had Sculptra, photo facial, micro needling, hydra facial, and gotten on a good skin care regimen. My family constantly complements my face and I just feel better about myself. I highly recommend the practice no matter what you're looking to do. If they don't do it it seems like they can always point you in the direction of someone who will. Kelly is amazing!!\",\n",

The practitioner I went to is very experienced and has top quality equipment but my results were a huge disappointment ! There is loose skin on my abdomen that kind of hangs which was not there before. My thighs have indents on the outer side where the fat has gone from some bits and not from others. My inner thighs are now loose skinned and wrinkled and to top it all the areas where the paddle was placed has created thread veins all over my legs. The only place that has not suffered was the flanks but I think no fat went from that area either. Unfortunately I have no pics as I have had it over the past year and none have been sent to me. By the way I am 47 5'6 and 110lbs and have been slim all my life but just wanted a sleeker silhouette. I have been left with areas of my body which are now worse than before.

The next day, I had two small applicators applied to each side of my flanks , one in front and one in back (four small in total).\\n             \\n\\n             My applications were done one at a time, but I know some places offer multiples at the same time if they have more machines. I didn\\'t worry about this taking a little more time. I actually found it quite relaxing, chilling out on my phone and catching up on work.\\n             \\n\\n             The process was really not as painful as I expected. It was actually quite easy with a just little discomfort here and there.\\n             \\n\\n             First, we did \"before\" pictures, documenting my mid-section all the way around. Then, she marked up the area for correct placement. The applicator is placed while you are standing. Then you ease onto the bed so as not to undermine the suction.\\n             \\n\\n             Before the applicator is put in place, she put a pad covered in protective gel over the area. It is COLD! But like jumping in a pool, that shock eases very quickly. Then she placed the applicator, it sucks up the fatty area like a vacuum. This is a little bit pinchy, but not unbearable. Then she turned on the cooling. The area numbs fairly quickly so it\\'s really not uncomfortable.\\n             \\n\\n             The massage after removal is a little tough, but again, not that bad. It goes by quickly.\\n             \\n\\n             Then, on to the next section!',\n",

       " {'body': \"I’ve always had a recessive chin but I had been a slim person my whole life so it was never an issue. I learned to stick my chin out in photos but always hated the sneaky candids people would take of me. This issue has become worse over the years as I’ve gained weight with menopause and my neck now seems to just drop off my chin. I have a feeling that I may inherit the dreaded turkey neck that my dear (departed) Mom had and as much as I loved her I don’t want that neck! I can’t recall how I found out about the new Coolsculpting mini but I was intrigued. I had two consults and decided to go with the place where I had laser hair removal years ago (with much success!). I went in for my treatment on March 7th and the tech took some before pictures then she made me comfortable in the chair and attached the applicator. I wasn’t to talk, cough or sneeze and so I just lay back and relaxed for the 45 minutes. Apparently it has been FDA approved to decrease the time to 45 minutes with a cooler temperature. It felt cool to start but then it was fine, I didn't even feel the suction. The worst part for me was the 2 minute massage immediately after the applicator was removed – yikes! The tech took a quick picture so I could see my square frozen stick of butter neck. Then we pressed a warm cloth up to my neck for a few minutes and it was over! My neck just looked red for about an hour and perhaps there was a little swelling for a few days but no one noticed anything. I did have some tenderness and numbness that was completely gone after 3 weeks. One thing I did do that I don’t know if it helped or not was to take Bromelain supplements and I also massaged my neck with Arnica cream. I didn’t end up with any bruising so the herbals may have helped, certainly didn't harm. So I am almost at week 5 and I can see a little difference. I have been taking photos for comparison and I have tried to keep the head position, lighting and location the same for consistency. I go back in May for my second treatment and am excited to see if improvements will continue!\\n*price above is converted to US$ at the current exchange rate but I paid $1575.00 CAN*\",\n",

I did, however, notice a couple of times there was the sound of bubbling or hissing on the left side, and the machine sounded like it was gearing down (not sure how to describe this), but after a couple of seconds I could feel it clamping on again. The tech did not know what caused the failure but apparently it can be trouble shooted through the company and the error code the machine displayed. So, I am a little disappointed but have re-booked again in a couple of weeks to do it all over again - no additional charge to me. When I got home I noticed that I had a little bruising on the left side which I didn't experience before.... Although I've been taking pics every week to compare my progress there has been no change that I could notice between the April 9th photo and today.

I was taking IBU on a regular basics and wondering if it would ever stop and hoping that this would be worth it. At day 12 my pain was gone and day by day the numbing sensation is getting better and better. I must say that my inner thighs have continued to stay numb but they have never hurt like my lower abdomen did.\\n             \\n\\n\\n              I am currently on day 27.
